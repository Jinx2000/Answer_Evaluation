The `Ingress` and `IngressClass` resources have transitioned to `networking.k8s.io/v1`. The `Ingress` and `IngressClass` types in the `extensions/v1beta1` and `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API versions are now deprecated and will not be available in version 1.22 and later. Existing objects can still be accessed through the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API. Key changes in the v1 `Ingress` objects (the field names from v1beta1 remain unchanged) include:\n* `spec.backend` is now `spec.defaultBackend`\n* `serviceName` is now `service.name`\n* `servicePort` is now `service.port.name` (for string values)\n* `servicePort` is now `service.port.number` (for numeric values)\n* The `pathType` no longer has a default value in v1; you must specify \"Exact\", \"Prefix\", or \"ImplementationSpecific\".\n\nAdditional updates to the `Ingress` API include:\n* Backends can now be either resource or service backends.\n* The `path` is no longer required to be a valid regular expression.\n\nIf you refer to the documentation for Ingress in version 1.19, the new syntax appears to be as shown above. Unfortunately, I do not have access to a 1.19 cluster to verify this myself, but I believe this is the issue you are encountering.",

            "official document: nginx supports load balancing by client-server mapping based on [consistent hashing](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#hash) for a given key. the key can contain text, variables or any combination thereof. this feature allows for request stickiness other than client ip or cookies. the [ketama](https://www.last.fm/user/rj/journal/2007/04/10/rz_libketama_-_a_consistent_hashing_algo_for_memcache_clients) consistent hashing method will be used which ensures only a few keys would be remapped to different servers on upstream group changes.  there is a special mode of upstream hashing called subset. in this mode, upstream servers are grouped into subsets, and stickiness works by mapping keys to a subset instead of individual upstream servers. specific server is chosen uniformly at random from the selected sticky subset. it provides a balance between stickiness and load distribution.  to enable consistent hashing for a backend:  `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by`: the nginx variable, text value or any combination thereof to use for consistent hashing. for example: `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: \"$request_uri\"` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: \"$request_uri$host\"` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: \"${request_uri}-text-value\"` to consistently hash upstream requests by the current request uri.  \"subset\" hashing can be enabled setting `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by-subset`: \"true\". this maps requests to subset of nodes instead of a single one. `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by-subset-size` determines the size of each subset (default 3).  please check the [chashsubset](../../examples/chashsubset/deployment.yaml) example. huawei cloud: the native nginx supports multiple load balancing rules, including weighted round robin and ip hash. nginx ingress supports load balancing by using consistent hashing based on the native nginx capabilities. by default, the ip hash method supported by nginx uses the linear hash space. the backend server is selected based on the hash value of the ip address. however, when this method is used to add or delete a node, all ip addresses need to be hashed again and then routed again. as a result, a large number of sessions are lost or the cache becomes invalid. therefore, consistent hashing is introduced to nginx ingress to solve this problem. consistent hashing is a special hash algorithm, which constructs a ring hash space to replace the common linear hash space. when a node is added or deleted, only the target route is migrated clockwise, and other routes do not need to be changed. in this way, rerouting can be reduced as much as possible, resolving the load balancing issue caused by dynamic node addition and deletion. if a consistent hashing rule is configured, the newly added server will share the load of all other servers. similarly, when a server is removed, all other servers can share the load of the removed server. this balances the load among nodes in the cluster and prevents the avalanche effect caused by the breakdown of a node. configuring a consistent hashing rule nginx ingress can use the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioupstream-hash-by annotation to configure consistent hashing rules. the following is an example create a yaml file named ingress-test.yaml. the file name can be customized. vi ingress-test.yaml for clusters of v1.23 or later apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata name ingress-test namespace default annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioupstream-hash-by request_uri # perform hashing based on the request uri. spec rules - host http paths - path backend service name your_service_name # replace it with the name of your target service. port number your_service_port # replace it with the port number of your target service. property ingress.beta.kubernetes.iourl-match-mode starts_with pathtype implementationspecific ingressclassname nginx for clusters of v1.21 or earlier apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata name ingress-test"

It is advisable to use an identity provider for Kubernetes, such as OpenID Connect, for user authentication. If you are utilizing GKE or ACS, you can integrate with their respective identity and access management frameworks. For self-hosted Kubernetes setups (like those using Kops), CoreOS/Dex can be employed to connect with LDAP or OAuth2 identity providers. A detailed two-part article on SSO for Kubernetes serves as a good reference. \n\nKops (version 1.10 and later) now features built-in authentication support, which simplifies the integration with AWS IAM as an identity provider for AWS users. There are also several open-source CLI clients available for Dex, such as nordstrom/kubelogin and pusher/k8s-auth-example. \n\nIf you are seeking a quick and easy (though not the most secure or manageable in the long run) method to get started, you can utilize service accounts with two options for specialized policies to control access. It is important to note that since version 1.6, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is strongly recommended, and this response does not cover RBAC setup. \n\nAdditionally, there is an outdated (2017-2018) guide by Bitnami on user setup with RBAC that may still be relevant. The steps to enable service account access are outlined above, and depending on your cluster configuration, these accounts may have full admin rights. A bash script is provided to automate the service account creation process. \n\nTo control user access with policies using ABAC, you will need to create a policy file, which is also included in the above YAML. This policy should be provisioned on every master node, and the API servers should be configured with the appropriate flags to enforce the policy, granting the specified user read-only access to resources in the designated namespace.",

In Kubernetes, a service account does not automatically have secrets unless they are explicitly created and linked. If you require a secret for this service account, you can create a Kubernetes Secret and then link it to the service account. Alternatively, if you want the service account to have a default token secret, ensure that it is created in a namespace that allows automatic secret generation, or you can manually create and associate a secret as needed.",

Refer to the \"urgent upgrade notes\" in the 1.24 changelog for more details. The `legacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate is in beta and is enabled by default. When this feature is active, secret API objects containing service account tokens will not be auto-generated for every service account. Instead, you can use the TokenRequest API to obtain service account tokens. If you require a non-expiring token, you can create a secret API object for the token controller to populate with a service account token by following the provided guide. \n\nThis means that in Kubernetes 1.24, you will need to create the secret manually, and the token key in the data field will be set automatically for you. Since you are creating the secret manually, you will know its name and won't need to look it up in the service account object. This method should also work in earlier versions of Kubernetes.",

To access the global context, you can use `$.` instead. According to the Helm documentation, there is one variable that is always global: `$`. This variable always points to the root context, which can be particularly useful when looping through a range and needing to reference the chart's release name. In your example, using this approach allows you to correctly reference the release name while iterating through the nodes.",

Alternatively, you can achieve cross-namespace ingress by using the `ExternalName` service type. This allows you to reference a service in a different namespace. The example provided demonstrates how to set up an `ExternalName` service and an `Ingress` resource that routes traffic to it.",

            "the first template we are going to create will be a  configmap . in kubernetes,\na configmap is simply an object for storing configuration data. other things,\nlike pods, can access the data in a configmap.because configmaps are basic resources, they make a great starting point for us.let's begin by creating a file called  mychart/templates/configmap.yaml :apiversion :   v1 \n kind :   configmap \n metadata : \n    name :   mychart-configmap \n data : \n    myvalue :   \"hello world\"tip:  template names do not follow a rigid naming pattern. however, we\nrecommend using the extension  .yaml  for yaml files and  .tpl  for helpers.the yaml file above is a bare-bones configmap, having the minimal necessary\nfields. by virtue of the fact that this file is in the  mychart/templates/ \ndirectory, it will be sent through the template engine.it is just fine to put a plain yaml file like this in the  mychart/templates/ \ndirectory. when helm reads this template, it will simply send it to kubernetes\nas-is.with this simple template, we now have an installable chart. and we can install\nit like this:$  helm install full-coral ./mychart\n name: full-coral\n last deployed: tue nov  1 17:36:01 2016\n namespace: default\n status: deployed\n revision: 1\n test suite: noneusing helm, we can retrieve the release and see the actual template that was\nloaded.$  helm get manifest full-coral\n \n ---\n #  source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml\n apiversion: v1\n kind: configmap\n metadata:\n   name: mychart-configmap\n data:\n   myvalue: \"hello world\"the  helm get manifest  command takes a release name ( full-coral ) and prints\nout all of the kubernetes resources that were uploaded to the server. each file\nbegins with  ---  to indicate the start of a yaml document, and then is followed\nby an automatically generated comment line that tells us what template file\ngenerated this yaml document.from there on, we can see that the yaml data is exactly what we put in our\n configmap.yaml  file.now we can uninstall our release:  helm uninstall full-coral .adding a simple template callhard-coding the  name:  into a resource is usually considered to be bad\npractice. names should be unique to a release. so we might want to generate a\nname field by inserting the release name.tip:  the  name:  field is limited to 63 characters because of limitations to\nthe dns system. for that reason, release names are limited to 53 characters.\nkubernetes 1.3 and earlier limited to only 24 characters (thus 14 character\nnames).let's alter  configmap.yaml  accordingly.apiversion :   v1 \n kind :   configmap \n metadata : \n    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap \n data : \n    myvalue :   \"hello world\"the big change comes in the value of the  name:  field, which is now\n {{ .release.name }}-configmap .a template directive is enclosed in  {{  and  }}  blocks.the template directive  {{ .release.name }}  injects the release name into the\ntemplate. the values that are passed into a template can be thought of as\n namespaced objects , where a dot ( . ) separates each namespaced element.the leading dot before  release  indicates that we start with the top-most\nnamespace for this scope (we'll talk about scope in a bit). so we could read\n .release.name  as \"start at the top namespace, find the  release  object, then\nlook inside of it for an object called  name \".the  release  object is one of the built-in objects for helm, and we'll cover it\nin more depth later. but for now, it is sufficient to say that this will display\nthe release name that the library assigns to our release.now when we install our resource, we'll immediately see the result of using this\ntemplate directive:$  helm install clunky-serval ./mychart\n name: clunky-serval\n last deployed: tue nov  1 17:45:37 2016\n namespace: default\n status: deployed\n revision: 1\n test suite: noneyou can run  helm get manifest clunky-serval  to see the entire generated yaml.note that the configmap inside kubernetes name is  clunky-serval-configmap \ninstead of  mychart-configmap  previously.at this point, we've"

Create a service account in the `my-data` project and assign it the necessary GCP roles/permissions (for example, `roles/bigquery.dataviewer` if your GKE containers need to read from BigQuery tables).\n\n2. Generate a service account key for that service account. When you do this in the Google Cloud Console, following the instructions at https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys, a JSON file containing the service account credentials will be automatically downloaded.\n\n3. Create a Kubernetes Secret resource to store those service account credentials. The YAML snippet above illustrates how this might look.\n\n4. Mount the credentials in the container that requires access. You can specify the volume and volume mount in your pod specification.\n\n5. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in the container to point to the path of the mounted credentials file.\n\nWith this setup, any official GCP clients (such as the GCP Python client, GCP Java client, or the gcloud CLI) will recognize the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and use the credentials of the service account you created when making API requests.",

There is no need for concern about this. I have observed similar warnings:\n\n```\n@microk8s:~$ kubectl describe ing\nwarning: extensions/v1beta1 ingress is deprecated in v1.14+, unavailable in v1.22+; use networking.k8s.io/v1 ingress\n```\n\nRegarding the reason for these warnings appearing even when you specify `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1`, here’s the explanation: This behavior is expected. When you create an ingress object, it can be accessed through any version, as the server manages the conversion to the requested version. The command `kubectl get ingress` is ambiguous because it does not specify which version you want to retrieve. In such cases, `kubectl` consults the discovery documents provided by the server to find the first group/version that includes the specified resource.\n\nHistorically, for compatibility reasons, `extensions/v1beta1` has been favored over other API versions. Now that ingress is the only resource left in that group, and since it has a GA replacement, version 1.20 will lower its priority so that `kubectl get ingress` will read from `networking.k8s.io/v1`. However, a server running version 1.19 will still adhere to the historical priority.\n\nIf you wish to retrieve a specific version, you can qualify the get request (e.g., `kubectl get ingresses.v1.networking.k8s.io ...`) or provide a manifest file to request the same version specified in the file (e.g., `kubectl get -f ing.yaml -o yaml`).\n\nIn summary, even though you are using the correct `apiVersion`, the deprecated version is still treated as the default, which is why you are seeing the warning. Additionally, I have noticed that changes are still being made, indicating ongoing work in this area.",

            "the first step in troubleshooting is triage.\nwhat is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.\ncheck the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:\n\nkubectl describe pods ${pod_name}\n\nlook at the state of the containers in the pod.\nare they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.\nmy pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.\ngenerally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.\nlook at the output of the\n\nkubectl describe ...\n\ncommand above.\nthere should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.\nreasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.\nsee compute resources document  for more information.\nyou are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.\nin most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.\nif you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.\nmy pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.\nagain, the information from\n\nkubectl describe ...\n\nshould be informative.\nthe most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.\nthere are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.\nhave you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.\nfor example, if you use docker on your pc, run\n\ndocker pull &lt;image&gt;\n\n.\nmy pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.\nthis typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.\nto identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.\nif the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.\ndisable the webhook for update operations.\nreport an issue with the corresponding provider.\nif you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.\nfor example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.\nfor a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.\nin other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.\nthis allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.\nmy pod is crashing or otherwise unhealthy once your pod has been scheduled, the methods described in debug running pods  are available for debugging.\nmy pod is running but not doing what i told it to do if your pod is not behaving as you expected, it may be that there was an error in your pod description (e.g.\n\nmypod.yaml\n\nfile on your local machine), and that the error was silently ignored when you created the pod.\noften a section of the pod description is nested incorrectly, or a key name is typed incorrectly, and so the key is ignored.\nfor example, if you misspelled command as commnd then the pod will be created but will not use the command line you intended it to use.\nthe first thing to do is to delete your pod and try creating it again with the --validate option.\nfor example, run\n\nkubectl apply --va",
            "a service is an object  (the same way that a pod or a configmap is an object).\nyou can create, view or modify service definitions using the kubernetes api.\nusually you use a tool such as kubectl to make those api calls for you.\nfor example, suppose you have a set of pods that each listen on tcp port 9376 and are labelled as\n\napp.kubernetes.io/name=myapp\n\n.\nyou can define a service to publish that tcp listener: service/simple-service.yaml \n\napiversion: v1\nkind: service\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp\n  ports:\n    - protocol: tcp\n      port: 80\n      targetport: 9376\n\napplying this manifest creates a new service named \"my-service\" with the default clusterip service type .\nthe service targets tcp port 9376 on any pod with the\n\napp.kubernetes.io/name: myapp\n\nlabel.\nkubernetes assigns this service an ip address (the cluster ip ), that is used by the virtual ip address mechanism.\nfor more details on that mechanism, read virtual ips and service proxies .\nthe controller for that service continuously scans for pods that match its selector, and then makes any necessary updates to the set of endpointslices for the service.\nthe name of a service object must be a valid rfc 1035 label name .\nnote: a service can map any incoming port to a targetport.\nby default and for convenience, the targetport is set to the same value as the port field.\nport definitions port definitions in pods have names, and you can reference these names in the targetport attribute of a service.\nfor example, we can bind the targetport of the service to the pod port in the following way:\n\napiversion: v1\nkind: pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\n  labels:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx:stable\n    ports:\n      - containerport: 80\n        name: http-web-svc\n\n---\napiversion: v1\nkind: service\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy\n  ports:\n  - name: name-of-service-port\n    protocol: tcp\n    port: 80\n    targetport: http-web-svc\n\nthis works even if there is a mixture of pods in the service using a single configured name, with the same network protocol available via different port numbers.\nthis offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving your services.\nfor example, you can change the port numbers that pods expose in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.\nthe default protocol for services is tcp ; you can also use any other supported protocol .\nbecause many services need to expose more than one port, kubernetes supports multiple port definitions  for a single service.\neach port definition can have the same protocol, or a different one.\nservices without selectors services most commonly abstract access to kubernetes pods thanks to the selector, but when used with a corresponding set of endpointslices  objects and without a selector, the service can abstract other kinds of backends, including ones that run outside the cluster.\nfor example: you want to have an external database cluster in production, but in your test environment you use your own databases.\nyou want to point your service to a service in a different namespace  or on another cluster.\nyou are migrating a workload to kubernetes.\nwhile evaluating the approach, you run only a portion of your backends in kubernetes.\nin any of these scenarios you can define a service without specifying a selector to match pods.\nfor example:\n\napiversion: v1\nkind: service\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      protocol: tcp\n      port: 80\n      targetport: 9376\n\nbecause this service has no selector, the corresponding endpointslice (and legacy endpoints) objects are not created automatically.\nyou can map the service to the network address and port where it's running, by adding an endpointslice object manually.\nfor example:\n\napiversion: discovery.k8s.io/v1\nkind: endpointslice\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service-1 # by convention, use the name"

Since a ServiceMonitor is designed to monitor services, I overlooked the necessity of creating a service, which is not included in the GitLab Helm chart. Ultimately, this YAML configuration resolved the issue for me, and the metrics are now visible in Prometheus. \n\nIt's worth noting that the target port for metrics is specified in the GitLab Runner chart.",

The `networkpolicy` resource in the `extensions/v1beta1` API version is no longer supported, and you should migrate to the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API version, which has been available since v1.8. Existing persisted data can still be accessed and modified using the new version.\n\nFor the second issue, you need to make several adjustments to your Ingress definition to ensure the Kubernetes dashboard is properly exposed on the MicroK8s cluster:\n\n1. Add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2`.\n2. Include the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | rewrite ^(/dashboard)$ $1/ redirect;`.\n3. Change the path from `path: /dashboard` to `path: /dashboard(/|$)(.*)`.\n\nThese changes are necessary to correctly forward requests to the backend pods. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation modifies the URL before it reaches the backend pods. In the path `/dashboard(/|$)(.*)`, the `(.*)` captures the dynamic URL generated when accessing the Kubernetes dashboard. The rewrite target annotation replaces this captured data in the URL before sending the request to the `kubernetes-dashboard` service. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` annotation ensures that a trailing slash (`/`) is added only when accessing `alb-url/dashboard`.\n\nAdditionally, you need to make two more changes:\n\n1. Add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"https\"` to instruct the NGINX Ingress to communicate with the dashboard service over HTTPS.\n2. Include the annotation `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: public` to specify the use of the NGINX Ingress created by the MicroK8s Ingress plugin.\n\nAfter implementing all the above changes, the final YAML configuration should work correctly without needing to run the MicroK8s proxy command.",

According to Kubernetes documentation, you can protect access to Traefik by following these steps:\n\n1. Create an authentication file using the `htpasswd` tool. You will be prompted to enter a password for the user:\n   ```bash\n   htpasswd -c ./auth\n   ```\n\n2. Use `kubectl` to create a secret in the `monitoring` namespace with the file generated by `htpasswd`:\n   ```bash\n   kubectl create secret generic mysecret --from-file=auth --namespace=monitoring\n   ```\n\n3. Enable basic authentication by adding annotations to the Ingress object:\n   - `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: \"basic\"`\n   - `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: \"mysecret\"`\n\nThe complete configuration for basic authentication would look like the YAML provided above. You can apply this configuration using the following command:\n```bash\nkubectl create -f prometheus-ingress.yaml -n monitoring\n```\n\nThis setup should work without any issues.",

However, pods can receive DNS names under specific conditions, which include the presence of a headless service, as detailed in the documentation. The requirements are as follows:\n\n- The pods must have a `hostname` field.\n- The pods must have a `subdomain` field.\n- There must be a headless service (within the same namespace) that selects the pods.\n- The name of the headless service must match the `subdomain` field of the pods.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, each pod is assigned a fully-qualified domain name in the format:\n\n`my-hostname.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local`\n\nHere, `my-hostname` corresponds to the `hostname` field of the pod, and `my-subdomain` corresponds to the `subdomain` field of the pod. \n\n**Note:** The DNS name is generated based on the pod's `hostname`, not its `name`.\n\nYou can verify this setup by executing the following commands after applying the configuration:\n\n```bash\nkubectl exec -ti my-pod-1 bash\n```\n\nFrom within one of the pods, you should be able to resolve the fully-qualified domain names of both pods:\n\n```bash\nhost my-hostname-1.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local\nhost my-hostname-2.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local\n```\n\nSince the requests are made from the same namespace as the target pods, you can simplify the domain names to:\n\n```bash\nhost my-hostname-1.my-subdomain\nhost my-hostname-2.my-subdomain\n```",

You can verify this by running the command `kubectl run -i --tty busybox --image=busybox -- sh`, which will start a BusyBox pod with an interactive shell. I recommend using the `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image instead. Additionally, ensure that you have the appropriate RBAC permissions set up, as you may encounter a \"forbidden\" error when trying to access services. The provided YAML configuration includes a Role and RoleBinding to grant the necessary permissions, along with a ServiceAccount and a CronJob that utilizes the `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image to patch a deployment in the specified namespace.",

In this example, I've added a `podFailurePolicy` that will fail the job if the container exits with code 1, which you can adjust based on your specific exit codes for test failures. \n\nThis configuration aligns with Kubernetes best practices for managing job failures and ensures that your cron job behaves as expected in the event of a test failure.",

I can confirm that when `backoffLimit` is set to 0 and `restartPolicy` is set to Never, the behavior is as expected, with no retries occurring. It's important to note that each execution of your job, which in this case is scheduled to run every 60 seconds (`schedule: \"*/1 * * * *\"`), is not considered a retry.\n\nLet's examine the following example (base YAML available here):\n\nThis configuration spawns a new CronJob every 60 seconds according to the schedule, regardless of whether it fails or succeeds. In this specific instance, it is set to fail since we are attempting to execute a non-existent command.\n\nYou can observe the status by running:\n\n```bash\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE\nhello-1587558720-pgqq9   0/1     Error               0          61s\nhello-1587558780-gpzxl   0/1     ContainerCreating    0          1s\n```\n\nAs shown, there are no retries. Even though the first pod failed, a new one is created exactly 60 seconds later as specified. I want to emphasize that this is not a retry.\n\nConversely, if we modify the example to set `backoffLimit: 3`, we can observe retries in action. In this case, new pods are created more frequently than every 60 seconds, indicating retries.\n\n```bash\n$ kubectl get pods\nNAME                     READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE\nhello-1587565260-7db6j   0/1     Error    0          106s\nhello-1587565260-tcqhv   0/1     Error    0          104s\nhello-1587565260-vnbcl   0/1     Error    0          94s\nhello-1587565320-7nc6z   0/1     Error    0          44s\nhello-1587565320-l4p8r   0/1     Error    0          14s\nhello-1587565320-mjnb6   0/1     Error    0          46s\nhello-1587565320-wqbm2   0/1     Error    0          34s\n```\n\nHere, we see three retries (pod creation attempts) associated with the `hello-1587565260` job and four retries (including the original attempt, which is not counted in the `backoffLimit: 3`) related to the `hello-1587565320` job.\n\nThe jobs themselves continue to run according to the schedule, at 60-second intervals:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get jobs\nNAME               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE\nhello-1587565260   0/1           2m12s      2m12s\nhello-1587565320   0/1           72s        72s\nhello-1587565380   0/1           11s        11s\n```\n\nHowever, due to the `backoffLimit` set to 3, every time the pod responsible for executing the job fails, three additional retries are initiated.\n\nI hope this clarifies any potential confusion regarding the operation of CronJobs in Kubernetes. If you're interested in executing a task just once rather than at regular intervals, consider using a simple Job instead of a CronJob. Additionally, if you wish to run this specific job regularly but less frequently, such as once every 24 hours, you may want to adjust your Cron configuration accordingly.",

Here are the scenarios I explored:\n\n**Scenario 1:**\n- Custom-named `IngressClass`\n- NGINX Ingress Controller with the default `--ingress-class` set to `nginx`\n- `Ingress` using the same name for `ingressClassName`\n\n**Output:** Response 404\n\n**Scenario 2:**\n- Custom-named `IngressClass`\n- NGINX Ingress Controller with `--ingress-class` set to `ingress-test`\n- `Ingress` using the same name for `ingressClassName`\n\n**Output:** Response 404\n\n**Scenario 3:**\n- `IngressClass` named `test`\n- NGINX Ingress Controller with `--ingress-class` set to `test`\n- `Ingress` using `test` in `ingressClassName`\n\n**Output:** Proper response\n\n**Scenario 4:**\n- `IngressClass` named `nginx`\n- NGINX Ingress Controller with `--ingress-class` set to `nginx`\n- `Ingress` using `nginx` in `ingressClassName`\n\n**Output:** Proper response\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIt's important to note that there are three types of NGINX: the open-source NGINX Ingress Controller (which you are likely using), NGINX Inc., and NGINX Inc. Plus. In one of my scenarios, when I specified `spec.controller: nginx.org/ingress-controller` with the NGINX Ingress Controller using `--ingress-class=nginx`, the NGINX Ingress Controller pod entered a crash loop. The logs indicated an invalid `IngressClass` (spec.controller) value of \"nginx.org/ingress-controller\", which should be \"k8s.io/ingress-nginx\".\n\nTo replicate this behavior, you need to deploy an `IngressClass` with the specific controller and then deploy NGINX. \n\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: IngressClass\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\nspec:\n  controller: nginx.org/ingress-controller\n```\n\nAfter deploying the NGINX Ingress Controller, the controller pod will be in a crash loop state. The logs will show an error indicating that the `spec.controller` value is invalid. It only works when the `IngressClass` name is set to `nginx`. \n\nI would suggest that `nginx.org/ingress-controller` is intended for NGINX Inc. and `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` is for the open-source NGINX Ingress. If a custom value is used for the `--ingress-class` argument in the controller deployment manifest, the presence or absence of an `IngressClass` object with the same name does not affect cluster behavior, as long as the `ingressClassName` in the `Ingress` spec matches the controller argument. Furthermore, if the `IngressClass` is present, the `spec.controller` can have any value that matches the required \"domain-like\" pattern without impacting the `Ingress` workflow.\n\nAdditionally, the `Ingress` functions correctly if the correct value for the `ingress-class` is set either in the `spec.ingressClassName` property or in the `metadata.annotations.kubernetes.io/ingress.class`. However, if both values are set in the same `Ingress` object, it will result in an error:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: test-ingress\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\nspec:\n  ingressClassName: nginx\n```\n\nThe error message will indicate that the `Ingress` \"test-ingress\" is invalid because the annotation and the class field cannot be set simultaneously. Please note that this was tested only with the NGINX Ingress Controller. If you plan to use `IngressClass` with other controllers like Traefik or Ambassador, be sure to check their release notes for compatibility.",

For instance, if you wish to delete the deployment, you can execute the following command:\n\n```bash\nkubectl delete deployment -l app=nginx\n```\n\nThis command will remove the entire deployment.\n\nThe second label is the selector, specifically `matchLabels`, which instructs resources (like services) to match pods based on their labels. For example, if you want to create a service that targets all pods labeled with `app=nginx`, you would use the definition provided above.\n\nThe service will search for the specified `matchLabels` and bind to the pods that have the label `app: nginx` assigned to them.\n\nThe third label pertains to the pod template labels. The template refers to the pod template that describes the pods to be launched. For instance, if you have a deployment with two replicas, Kubernetes will create two pods with the labels specified in the template's `metadata.labels`. This distinction is subtle but significant, as it allows for different labels for the deployment and the pods generated by that deployment.",

        "reference_answer": "```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-secret\ndata:\n  secret.file1: |\n    c2vjcmv0rmlsztek\n  secret.file2: |\n    c2vjcmv0rmlsztik\n---\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  ...\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - image: nginx\n    name: nginx\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: secrets-files\n      mountPath: \"/mnt/secret.file1\"  # \"secret.file1\" file will be created in \"/mnt\" directory\n      subPath: secret.file1\n    - name: secrets-files\n      mountPath: \"/mnt/secret.file2\"  # \"secret.file2\" file will be created in \"/mnt\" directory\n      subPath: secret.file2\n  volumes:\n    - name: secrets-files\n      secret:\n        secretName: my-secret  # name of the secret\n```\n### Explanation\nSecrets are designed to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords and private keys, while ConfigMaps are intended for non-sensitive configuration data. According to the documentation, a Secret is an object that holds a small amount of sensitive data, like a password, token, or key. On the other hand, a ConfigMap allows you to separate environment-specific configurations from your container images, making your applications more portable.\n\nYou can create a Secret and mount it as one or more files in your Pods. Below is a simple example demonstrating how this works. The sample includes a Secret manifest file and a Deployment that utilizes this Secret. Note that I used `subPath` with the Secrets, and it functions as expected.\n\nBefore deploying, ensure that the Secret is created. After creating both the Secret and Deployment, you can verify their functionality with the following commands:\n\n```bash\n$ kubectl get secret,deploy,pod\n```\n\nThis will show the status of the Secret, Deployment, and Pod. You can also check the contents of the mounted files using:\n\n```bash\n$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- ls /mnt\n$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat /mnt/secret.file1\n$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat /mnt/secret.file2\n```\n\n### Projected Volume\nA more effective approach to achieve your goal is to use a projected volume. A projected volume allows you to map multiple existing volume sources into the same directory. The documentation provides a detailed explanation, but I have also created an example to illustrate how it works. In this example, I mounted `secret.file1`, `secret.file2` from a Secret, and `config.file1` from a ConfigMap as files within the Pod.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: my-secret\ndata:\n  secret.file1: |\n    c2vjcmv0rmlsztek\n  secret.file2: |\n    c2vjcmv0rmlsztik\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: my-config\ndata:\n  config.file1: |\n    configfile1  \n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: all-in-one\n      mountPath: \"/config-volume\"\n      readOnly: true\n  volumes:\n  - name: all-in-one\n    projected:\n      sources:\n      - secret:\n          name: my-secret\n          items:\n            - key: secret.file1\n              path: secret-dir1/secret.file1\n            - key: secret.file2\n              path: secret-dir2/secret.file2\n      - configMap:\n          name: my-config\n          items:\n            - key: config.file1\n              path: config-dir1/config.file1\n```\n\nYou can verify the functionality of this setup with the following commands:\n\n```bash\n$ kubectl exec nginx -- ls /config-volume\n$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/config-dir1/config.file1\n$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/secret-dir1/secret.file1\n$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/secret-dir2/secret.file2\n```\n\nIf this response does not address your question, please provide more details about your Secret and your specific objectives.",

I included both secrets in my YAML file as you did, and the pods were created successfully, with the container running without issues. The `regcred` secret contains the correct values, while `regcred-test` is just a random string.

For pods in `namespace-a`, this policy permits ingress traffic only from other pods within `namespace-a`, while denying ingress from any other sources. Egress traffic remains unrestricted.\n\nSimilarly, for pods in `namespace-b`, the policy allows ingress only from pods in `namespace-b`, again denying ingress from any other sources, with unrestricted egress.\n\nIt's important to ensure that you have applied the appropriate labels to your namespaces, such as:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: namespace-a\n  labels:\n    name: namespace-a\n    other: labelname\n```\n\nThis labeling is crucial to avoid confusion, as the labels used in the `NetworkPolicy` must correspond to the actual labels assigned to your namespaces. The labels can be arbitrary and may include multiple namespaces; for instance, both `namespace-a` and `namespace-c` could share a label like `other: labelname`, allowing you to select multiple namespaces with a single `namespaceSelector` in your `NetworkPolicy`.",

This method allows you to manage your configuration files separately while ensuring they are correctly formatted in the resulting Kubernetes object.\n\n### Best Practices:\n- Organizing configuration files in a dedicated directory (like `configs/`) helps maintain clarity and manageability.\n- Using the `Files.Get` method to include file contents directly into your ConfigMap is a recommended practice for managing multiple configuration files effectively.",

However, if you need to reference variable values within those files, which allows for content control from `values.yaml`, you might want to consider a different approach. For instance, if you want to expose each value individually, the Helm documentation provides an example using the `range` function. A suitable approach for your case is similar to what the stable/mysql chart does, where a ConfigMap is created that accepts values as strings:\n\n```yaml\n{{- if .Values.configurationFiles }}\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ template \"mysql.fullname\" . }}-configuration\ndata:\n{{- range $key, $val := .Values.configurationFiles }}\n  {{ $key }}: |-\n{{ $val | indent 4 }}\n{{- end }}\n{{- end -}}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `values.yaml` file allows users to set and override both the files and their content. The commented-out section provides a template for users to customize their MySQL configuration files, while you can also include default values in `values.yaml`. The `tpl` function is only necessary if you require additional flexibility, as seen in the stable/keycloak chart, which allows users to create their own ConfigMap and reference it in the Keycloak deployment. However, for your scenario, the approach used in the MySQL chart is likely the most appropriate. Additionally, the `tpl` function can be utilized to incorporate content from files loaded with `files.get`, effectively integrating that content into the template. For more information, you can refer to the question on loading multiple templated config files into a Helm chart.",

This approach aligns with the Kubernetes philosophy of declarative management. The ArgoCD documentation includes a section on additional configuration, detailing the flags available in the `argocd-cmd-params-cm` ConfigMap, such as the `server.insecure` flag, which allows the server to run without TLS.\n\nThe ArgoCD server deployment, as provided in the manifest from the official repository, will utilize this parameter if it is defined in the `argocd-cmd-params-cm` ConfigMap. To set up ArgoCD declaratively, the documentation provides guidance on using Kustomize, which the ArgoCD team employs for their own deployments. A live instance can be found at https://cd.apps.argoproj.io/, with the configuration available on GitHub.\n\nTo adapt this for our needs, we will transition our ArgoCD installation from using `kubectl apply -f` to a Kustomize-based installation. The documentation outlines the necessary steps, which include creating a directory for the ArgoCD installation and a `kustomization.yaml` file. We enhance the proposed `kustomization.yaml` to include the remote resource and apply customizations through patches.\n\nNext, we create a new file named `argocd-cmd-params-cm-patch.yml`, which contains the specific configuration changes we want to make to the `argocd-cmd-params-cm` ConfigMap. Finally, we install ArgoCD using the Kustomize files with `kubectl apply -k`, ensuring the ArgoCD namespace is created beforehand. This process configures the ArgoCD server deployment to use the `--insecure` flag, allowing Traefik to handle TLS termination, and we can access the ArgoCD dashboard at the expected URL.",

If your goal is to use the NGINX Ingress Controller solely as a reverse proxy, each ingress rule automatically generates a `proxy_pass` directive to the corresponding upstream or backend service.\n\nIf the paths in your ingress rule match those of your backend service, you do not need to specify a rewrite rule; simply defining the path for the backend service is sufficient. However, if the paths differ, you should consider using the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation to avoid encountering a 404 backend error.\n\nFor instance, to redirect requests coming to the frontend at `http://example.com/something` to the backend service at `example-com/something`, your ingress rule should resemble the example provided above.\n\nFor further details on annotations, please refer to the NGINX Ingress annotations documentation. Additionally, if you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the NGINX Ingress Controller pod using the command:\n\n```bash\nkubectl logs nginx-ingress-controller-xxxxx\n```\n\nI hope this information is helpful!",

The current setup, which involves having a separate file for each resource while maintaining some logical duplication, is a fairly common approach. It clearly delineates the resources being created and minimizes complexity. The Go templating language can be somewhat specialized, making this method more accessible for others involved in your project.\n\nIf you prefer to consolidate resources, there are a few alternatives. As noted by @matt in their comment, you can include multiple Kubernetes resources within a single file, provided they are separated by the YAML document separator (`---`). \n\nThe key requirement is that the output of the template must form a valid multi-document YAML file. You can utilize the `helm template` command to preview the output without deploying it to the cluster. This method works well with a list of configuration rules defined in your YAML file, such as:\n\n```yaml\ningresses:\n  - name: apps-ingress\n    annotations:\n      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: hybrid-external\n      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"http\"\n  - name: apps-ingress-private\n    annotations:\n      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: hybrid-internal\n      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: \"http\"\n```\n\nYou can leverage the Go template `range` construct to iterate over these entries. Note that this utilizes the `.` special variable, so if you need to reference other elements in `.Values`, you should store the current value first:\n\n```yaml\n{{- $top := . -}}\n{{- range $ingress := .Values.ingresses -}}\n---\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ $ingress.name }}\n  annotations: {{- $ingress.annotations | toYaml | nindent 4 }}\n...\n{{ end }}\n```",

            "here's an exhaustive list of all the major changes introduced in helm 3.removal of tillerduring the helm 2 development cycle, we introduced tiller. tiller played an\nimportant role for teams working on a shared cluster - it made it possible for\nmultiple different operators to interact with the same set of releases.with role-based access controls (rbac) enabled by default in kubernetes 1.6,\nlocking down tiller for use in a production scenario became more difficult to\nmanage. due to the vast number of possible security policies, our stance was to\nprovide a permissive default configuration. this allowed first-time users to\nstart experimenting with helm and kubernetes without having to dive headfirst\ninto the security controls. unfortunately, this permissive configuration could\ngrant a user a broad range of permissions they weren’t intended to have. devops\nand sres had to learn additional operational steps when installing tiller into a\nmulti-tenant cluster.after hearing how community members were using helm in certain scenarios, we\nfound that tiller’s release management system did not need to rely upon an\nin-cluster operator to maintain state or act as a central hub for helm release\ninformation. instead, we could simply fetch information from the kubernetes api\nserver, render the charts client-side, and store a record of the installation in\nkubernetes.tiller’s primary goal could be accomplished without tiller, so one of the first\ndecisions we made regarding helm 3 was to completely remove tiller.with tiller gone, the security model for helm is radically simplified. helm 3\nnow supports all the modern security, identity, and authorization features of\nmodern kubernetes. helm’s permissions are evaluated using your\n kubeconfig\nfile .\ncluster administrators can restrict user permissions at whatever granularity\nthey see fit. releases are still recorded in-cluster, and the rest of helm’s\nfunctionality remains.improved upgrade strategy: 3-way strategic merge patcheshelm 2 used a two-way strategic merge patch. during an upgrade, it compared the\nmost recent chart's manifest against the proposed chart's manifest (the one\nsupplied during  helm upgrade ). it compared the differences between these two\ncharts to determine what changes needed to be applied to the resources in\nkubernetes. if changes were applied to the cluster out-of-band (such as during a\n kubectl edit ), those changes were not considered. this resulted in resources\nbeing unable to roll back to its previous state: because helm only considered\nthe last applied chart's manifest as its current state, if there were no changes\nin the chart's state, the live state was left unchanged.in helm 3, we now use a three-way strategic merge patch. helm considers the old\nmanifest, its live state, and the new manifest when generating a patch.exampleslet's go through a few common examples what this change impacts.rolling back where live state has changedyour team just deployed their application to production on kubernetes using\nhelm. the chart contains a deployment object where the number of replicas is set\nto three:$  helm install myapp ./myappa new developer joins the team. on their first day while observing the\nproduction cluster, a horrible coffee-spilling-on-the-keyboard accident happens\nand they  kubectl scale  the production deployment from three replicas down to\nzero.$  kubectl scale --replicas = 0  deployment/myappanother developer on your team notices that the production site is down and\ndecides to rollback the release to its previous state:$  helm rollback myappwhat happens?in helm 2, it would generate a patch, comparing the old manifest against the new\nmanifest. because this is a rollback, it's the same manifest. helm would\ndetermine that there is nothing to change because there is no difference between\nthe old manifest and the new manifest. the replica count continues to stay at\nzero. panic ensues.in helm 3, the patch is generated using the old manifest, the live state, and\nthe new manifest. helm recognizes that the old state was at three"

Here’s how I replicated the problem:\n\n1. I used Kubernetes version 1.15.3 on GKE and Helm version 3.1.1 with the stable/nginx-ingress chart.\n2. After fetching and extracting the Helm chart, I modified the service type in the `values.yaml` file from `LoadBalancer` to `NodePort`.\n3. Upon installing the chart, I confirmed that the service type was indeed set to `NodePort`.\n4. I then changed the service type back to `LoadBalancer` in the `values.yaml` file and attempted to upgrade the chart using the `--force` flag.\n\nThis resulted in an error indicating that the service was invalid due to an immutable field (`spec.clusterIP`). \n\nUpon reviewing the Helm source code, I found that when the `--force` flag is used, Helm attempts to replace the existing resource rather than patching it. This behavior is similar to the `kubectl replace` command, which does not allow changes to immutable fields like `spec.clusterIP`. In contrast, using `kubectl patch` allows for changing the service type without encountering this issue.\n\nTo work around this, I recommend using `helm upgrade` without the `--force` flag. If you must use `--force`, manually update the service specifications before the upgrade. Alternatively, you can export the service YAML, modify the type, and apply it again, which allows for a successful replacement. \n\nThis approach ensures that subsequent `helm upgrade --force` commands will work without issues, as long as there are no changes to the service itself. I hope this information is helpful!",

In your scenario, the output of `...AsConfig` is a string that can be processed by the template engine. By using this approach, you can incorporate arbitrary template logic directly within your configuration file.

In the Kubernetes Persistent Volume documentation, it states that NFS supports all types of access modes: ReadWriteOnce (RWO), ReadOnlyMany (ROX), and ReadWriteMany (RWX). However, access modes should be viewed as matching criteria, similar to storage size, and this is explained more clearly in the OpenShift access mode documentation.\n\nA PersistentVolume (PV) can be mounted in various ways depending on the capabilities of the resource provider. Each provider has different capabilities, and the access modes for each PV are determined by the specific modes supported by that volume. For instance, while NFS can support multiple read-write clients, a specific NFS PV might be exported as read-only on the server. Each PV has its own set of access modes that describe its capabilities.\n\nWhen a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is created, it is matched to volumes with similar access modes. The only criteria for matching are access modes and size. A claim's access modes represent a request, meaning you may be granted more access than requested, but never less. For example, if a claim requests RWO but the only available volume is an NFS PV that supports RWO, ROX, and RWX, the claim will match the NFS PV because it meets the RWO requirement.\n\nDirect matches are prioritized first. The volume's access modes must match or include more modes than requested, and the size must be equal to or greater than what is specified. If two types of volumes, such as NFS and iSCSI, have the same access modes, either can fulfill a claim with those modes. There is no preference between volume types, and no way to select one type over another.\n\nAll volumes with the same access modes are grouped and sorted by size, from smallest to largest. The binder selects the group with matching modes and iterates through them in size order until it finds a suitable match.\n\nAccess modes are descriptors of a volume's capabilities rather than enforced constraints. The storage provider is responsible for any runtime errors that arise from improper use of the resource.\n\nFor example, NFS offers the ReadWriteOnce access mode, but if you want to utilize the ROX capability, you must specify the claims as read-only. Errors from the provider will manifest at runtime as mount errors.\n\nAnother example illustrates that you can specify multiple access modes since they serve as matching criteria rather than constraints:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: example-pvc-rwo-rom\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadOnlyMany\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n```\n\nWhen you check the status of the PVCs, you may find that one PVC is in a pending state because the default GKE gcePersistentDisk does not support ReadWriteMany. In contrast, the second PVC, `example-pvc-rwo-rom`, is successfully created and shows two access modes: RWO and ROX. In summary, access modes are more like requirements for PVC/PV binding. If an NFS volume that supports all access modes binds with RWO, it fulfills the requirement while still functioning as RWM due to its capabilities. I hope this clarifies the concept for you. Additionally, you may want to explore other discussions on Stack Overflow regarding access modes.",

If your assets are already included in the image at `/var/www`, mounting an `emptyDir` volume at that location will replace everything there with the empty directory's content, which is initially empty. This results in the loss of your assets, likely causing your Node server to fail.\n\nTo resolve this, you should mount the `emptyDir` volume at a different path, such as `/data`. Then, modify your Node container's command to copy the assets from `/var/www/*` to `/data`, which will be used for your `pwa-disk` volume. \n\nAdditionally, it's important to clarify the role of init containers. They are designed to run and complete before any other containers in the pod start. Therefore, you should not run your Node server as an init container, as it is intended to remain running. Instead, declare your Node server alongside your Nginx container in the `containers` section. You can keep the asset copying command in the init container section, ensuring that the assets are copied to the volume before the main containers start. The overall structure should resemble the provided YAML configuration.",

This setup assumes that your Kubernetes cluster is running in an internal network and that there is a firewall between the cluster and the internet. \n\n1. **MetalLB**: Since Kubernetes does not provide a built-in load balancer for bare metal clusters, you can use MetalLB to assign an external IP address to your services. This is particularly useful for on-premise setups where cloud provider load balancers are not available.\n\n2. **NGINX Ingress Controller**: You will need to modify the service configuration of the NGINX Ingress Controller to work with MetalLB. This involves specifying the address pool in the service annotations.\n\n3. **Firewall Configuration**: You will need to set up port forwarding on your firewall to direct traffic from the firewall's public IP to the internal IP assigned by MetalLB. For example, you would configure the firewall to forward traffic from `firewall_ip:80` to `single_ip:80` and `firewall_ip:443` to `single_ip:443`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that users can connect to your NGINX Ingress Controller, which will expose your application to the internet. For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the official Kubernetes documentation on creating external load balancers and configuring services.",

To resolve this, ensure that the persistent volume claim (`postgres-pv-claim`) is either empty or that any existing data is removed before deploying the PostgreSQL pod. Additionally, confirm that the `mountPath` in the `volumeMounts` section is correctly set to `/var/lib/postgresql/data`, which is the expected data directory for PostgreSQL. This will help prevent initialization errors related to pre-existing data.",

Instead, change the path to `/var/lib/postgres/whatever`, and it should function correctly.\n\nWhen it comes to using secondary file systems, many setups create their database clusters on volumes other than the machine's root volume. If you opt for this approach, it is not recommended to use the topmost directory of the secondary volume (the mount point) as the data directory. The best practice is to create a subdirectory within the mount-point directory that is owned by the PostgreSQL user, and then establish the data directory within that. This method helps prevent permission issues, especially during operations like `pg_upgrade`, and ensures that failures are handled cleanly if the secondary volume goes offline.\n\nAdditionally, I had to create a secret, as it was not included in the post. Please note that the username must be \"postgres.\" I'm not sure if you are addressing this in your setup.",

            "kustomize is a tool for customizing kubernetes configurations.\nit has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.\nthe source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a\n\n.properties\n\nfile or an ssh keyfile.\nkustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.\nconfigmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.\nhere is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a\n\n.properties\n\nfile:\n\n# create a application.properties file\ncat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties\nfoo=bar\neof\n\ncat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml\nconfigmapgenerator:\n- name: example-configmap-1\n  files:\n  - application.properties\neof\n\nthe generated configmap can be examined with the following command:\n\nkubectl kustomize ./\n\nthe generated configmap is:\n\napiversion: v1\ndata:\n  application.properties: |\n    foo=bar    \nkind: configmap\nmetadata:\n  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g\n\nto generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.\nhere is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a\n\n.env\n\nfile:\n\n# create a .env file\ncat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env\nfoo=bar\neof\n\ncat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml\nconfigmapgenerator:\n- name: example-configmap-1\n  envs:\n  - .env\neof\n\nthe generated configmap can be examined with the following command:\n\nkubectl kustomize ./\n\nthe generated configmap is:\n\napiversion: v1\ndata:\n  foo: bar\nkind: configmap\nmetadata:\n  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f\n\nnote: each variable in the\n\n.env\n\nfile becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.\nthis is different from the previous example which embeds a file named\n\napplication.properties\n\n(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.\nconfigmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.\nto generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.\nhere is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:\n\ncat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml\nconfigmapgenerator:\n- name: example-configmap-2\n  literals:\n  - foo=bar\neof\n\nthe generated configmap can be checked by the following command:\n\nkubectl kustomize ./\n\nthe generated configmap is:\n\napiversion: v1\ndata:\n  foo: bar\nkind: configmap\nmetadata:\n  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk\n\nto use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.\nkustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.\nthis is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:\n\n# create an application.properties file\ncat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties\nfoo=bar\neof\n\ncat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;deployment.yaml\napiversion: apps/v1\nkind: deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: my-app\n  labels:\n    app: my-app\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchlabels:\n      app: my-app\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: my-app\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: app\n        image: my-app\n        volumemounts:\n        - name: config\n          mountpath: /config\n      volumes:\n      - name: config\n        configmap:\n          name: example-configmap-1\neof\n\ncat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml\nresources:\n- deployment.yaml\nconfigmapgenerator:\n- name: example-configmap-1\n  files:\n  - application.properties\neof\n\ngenerate the configmap and deployment:\n\nkubectl kustomize ./\n\nthe generated deployment will refer to the generated configmap by name:\n\napiversion: v1\ndata:\n  application.properties: |\n    foo=bar    \nkind: configmap\nmetadata:\n  name: e",

The installation sequence follows these steps: (7) install resources tagged as hooks, (8) wait for those to be ready, and then (9) install the remaining resources; it ensures that the job completes before proceeding to install any dependent secrets. \n\nTo ensure your secret is installed during the pre-install phase, you must tag it as a hook with a modified weight, allowing it to be installed before the main job (lower weight numbers indicate earlier installation). \n\nRegarding the deletion of this secret, the documentation specifies that `helm uninstall` will not remove hook resources. To manage this, you need to add a separate `helm.sh/hook-delete-policy` annotation; otherwise, the secret will persist until the next scheduled execution of the hook. This implies that if you modify the secret (or its values) and upgrade the chart (instead of deleting and reinstalling), the secret will not be updated. \n\nA practical approach would be to create two versions of the secret: one for pre-installation and another for the primary chart lifecycle. You can define a template for the secret's content and invoke it twice.",

        "reference_answer": "```yaml\napiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\nresources:\n  - myingress.yml\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe `configMapRef` and `secretRef` for the `envFrom` and `valueFrom` functions are limited to environment variables, which means they cannot be utilized in this context. As of Kubernetes version 1.18.0, the desired functionality is not natively supported. \n\nHowever, it is achievable through tools like Helm and Kustomize, which are among the best options for this purpose. Helm acts as a templating engine for Kubernetes manifests, allowing you to create generic manifests and define the differences between your desired configurations using variables in a separate file. At runtime, these variables are automatically injected into the template.\n\nKustomize, which I personally recommend, offers a different approach. It generates customized manifests from generic ones without using templating. Instead, Kustomize performs merge patches between YAML or JSON files at runtime, referred to as overlays. This makes it particularly effective for managing environments with numerous manifests, as it can handle recursive directory structures of bases and overlays, enhancing scalability.\n\nTo implement this, you would start by creating a `kustomization.yml` file where you define your resources, such as `myingress`:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\nresources:\n  - myingress.yml\n```\n\nNext, set up a directory structure. Create a directory named `example` with a subdirectory called `base`. Inside `./example/base/`, create a `kustomization.yml` file with the above content. Then, create a `myingress.yml` file in the same directory and populate it with the following ingress configuration:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: myingress\nspec:\n  tls:\n    - hosts:\n      - config.my_domain\n      secretName: mytls\n  rules:\n    - host: config.my_domain\n      http:\n        paths:\n          - backend:\n              serviceName: myservice\n              servicePort: 3000\n```\n\nNow, define your first overlay by creating a directory `./example/overlays/domain-a` and adding a `kustomization.yml` file with the following content:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\nbases:\n  - ../../../base/\npatchesStrategicMerge:\n  - ing_patch.yml\nconfigMapGenerator:\n  - name: config_a\n    literals:\n      - my_domain='domain_a'\n```\n\nNext, create the patch file `ing_patch.yml` in the same overlay directory:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: myingress\nspec:\n  tls:\n    - hosts:\n      - domain.a.com\n  rules:\n    - host: domain.a.com\n```\n\nWith this setup, you can now generate the final manifest using either `kubectl` or `kustomize`:\n\n```bash\nkubectl kustomize ./example/overlays/domain_a\n# or\nkustomize build ./example/overlays/domain_a\n```\n\nRunning one of these commands will produce output containing the two files, `myingress` and `config`, with `myingress` reflecting the domain configuration specified in your overlay's patch.\n\nYou might wonder why Kustomize exists if `kubectl` supports similar features. Kustomize originated as an external project, and its binary often runs a newer version than what's available in `kubectl`.\n\nTo create a second overlay, simply copy the first one:\n\n```bash\ncp -r ./example/overlays/domain_a ./example/overlays/domain_b\n```\n\nThen, modify `./example/overlays/domain_b/ing_patch.yml` to reflect the new domain:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: myingress\nspec:\n  tls:\n    - hosts:\n      - domain.b.com\n  rules:\n    - host: domain.b.com\n```\n\nAfter saving the changes, build both overlays:\n\n```bash\nkustomize build ./example/overlays/domain_a\nkustomize build ./example/overlays/domain_b\n```\n\nNotice how the output varies based on the patches in each overlay directory. You can continue to abstract this pattern by nesting bases and overlays, allowing for powerful and efficient scaling of your project. Finally, apply the configurations to your API server:\n\n```bash\nkubectl apply -k ./example/overlays/domain_a\nkubectl apply -k ./example/overlays/domain_b\n```\n\nThis is just the beginning of what Kustomize can do. As indicated by the `configMapGenerator` field in each overlay's `kustomization.yml`, Kustomize includes many features, such as adding labels to resources, overriding namespaces, and modifying container image information. \n\nI hope this information is helpful.

Notable changes include the requirement to specify `pathType` for each path and the updated structure for the backend service references. \n\nFor the `service.yaml`, it remains in the `v1` API version, but I ensured that the service definitions align with the latest standards.

If you need to introduce a custom location within the server context, you should utilize the `server-snippet` annotation instead. By using `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet`, you can insert custom configurations directly into the server block of the NGINX configuration.\n\nTo ensure proper functionality, you may need to apply certain modifiers and regular expressions, such as `~*` for case-insensitive matching and `^` for matching the start of a string. The provided configuration should work effectively. \n\nAfter applying the configuration, you can verify the final NGINX configuration by executing the following command:\n```bash\n$ kubectl exec -n kube-system nginx-ingress-controller-6fc5bcc8c9-chkxf -- cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n```\nThis will display the NGINX configuration, which should include the custom location block you defined.",

This allows the StatefulSet to use the pre-existing Persistent Volume Claim (`my-app-data`) instead of creating new Persistent Volume Claims for each replica. Ensure that the Persistent Volume Claim is created and bound to the Persistent Volume before deploying the StatefulSet. This approach aligns with best practices for managing storage in Kubernetes.",

Each PersistentVolume (PV) and PVC will bind exclusively to one another. If your PVC is already bound to a volume, any PVCs created by the StatefulSet won't be able to bind to that volume, rendering it unused.\n\nIn your scenario, the provided PersistentVolume and StatefulSet configurations should work effectively. Ensure that you delete any manually created PersistentVolumeClaim to avoid binding conflicts with your PersistentVolume. Additionally, verify that the storage class name is correctly set in both the PersistentVolume and the volumeClaimTemplates section of the StatefulSet; otherwise, the PVC created by the StatefulSet may fail to bind to your volume.",

To do this, you need to create a headless service that points to your Keycloak pods (a headless service is a standard service with `clusterIP: None`). Additionally, you should set the environment variable `KC_CACHE_STACK` to `kubernetes` to activate the Kubernetes JGroups configurations, and use `JAVA_OPTS_APPEND` to specify how to locate the other Keycloak pods via DNS.\n\nWhen Keycloak starts, JGroups will perform a DNS query for the headless service (for example, `keycloak-headless.my_namespace.svc.cluster.local`), which will return the IP addresses of all pods associated with that service. JGroups will then connect to each IP on the communication port to establish the cluster.\n\n**Update (2022-08-01):** The configuration provided above is for Keycloak versions up to 16. Starting from version 17, Keycloak has transitioned to the Quarkus distribution, which requires a different configuration approach. \n\nFor Keycloak versions up to 16, the `kube_ping` mechanism operates similarly to executing `kubectl get pods` within a Keycloak pod to discover the IPs of other Keycloak pods. However, instead of using `kubectl`, Keycloak queries the Kubernetes API directly, which necessitates access credentials in the form of an access token. \n\nTo securely provide this token, you can create a service account, assign it the necessary permissions through a role binding, and specify that account in the pod configuration. The token will be mounted as a file at a predetermined location, which is expected by all Kubernetes clients. When the client needs to call the API, it retrieves the token from that location.\n\nIf you lack the permissions to create role bindings, you can request an administrator to set up the service account and role binding for you, or you can pass your own user's token (if you have the necessary permissions) using the `sa_token_file` environment variable. This file can be created using a secret or config map, mounted to the pod, and the `sa_token_file` variable can be set to the file's location. Note that this method is specific to the JGroups library used by Keycloak.\n\nIf you have the necessary permissions to create service accounts and role bindings in the cluster, you can follow the example below (not tested):\n\n```bash\nexport TARGET_NAMESPACE=default\n\n# Create a service account\nkubectl create serviceaccount keycloak-kubeping-service-account -n $TARGET_NAMESPACE\n\n# Define the role and role binding\ncat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -\nkind: Role\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: keycloak-kubeping-pod-reader\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]\n  resources: [\"pods\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"list\"]\n\n---\n\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: keycloak-kubeping-api-access\nroleRef:\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n  kind: Role\n  name: keycloak-kubeping-pod-reader\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: keycloak-kubeping-service-account\n  namespace: $TARGET_NAMESPACE\nEOF\n```\n\nIn your deployment configuration, specify the service account:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: keycloak\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      serviceAccountName: keycloak-kubeping-service-account\n      containers:\n      - name: keycloak\n        image: jboss/keycloak\n        env:\n          - name: JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL\n            value: kubernetes.kube_ping\n          - name: JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES\n            value: dump_requests=true\n          - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE\n            valueFrom:\n              fieldRef:\n                apiVersion: v1\n                fieldPath: metadata.namespace\n```\n\nSetting `dump_requests=true` can help with debugging Kubernetes requests, but it's advisable to set it to false in production. You can also use `namespace=<your_namespace>` instead of `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE`, but the latter allows the pod to automatically detect the namespace in which it is running. Keep in mind that `kube_ping` will discover all pods in the namespace, not just Keycloak pods, and will attempt to connect to all of them. If other pods are not affected by this, it should be fine.",

You need to set up a service that acts as the entry point for external access, as detailed in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#what-is-ingress). Essentially, the flow of traffic is as follows: ingress -> services -> pods. \n\nSince you are not using AWS or Google Cloud, you will need to utilize either `externalIP` or `NodePort` and configure the service accordingly. Additionally, DNS management is necessary for your domain resolution. For local testing, you can modify your `/etc/hosts` file. \n\nIn cloud environments like AWS or Google Cloud, you would typically create a service of type `LoadBalancer` and direct your DNS records to the load balancer's address (using CNAME for AWS and the IP address for Google).",

A discussion about this was held on GitHub, and a solution was provided in that thread. Instead of using the `force-ssl-redirect` annotation, you should create a custom ConfigMap for the NGINX Ingress controller as shown above. This configuration will set up an additional listener that performs a simple redirection to HTTPS. After applying this ConfigMap to your Ingress controller, ensure to add NodePort 8080 to its container definition and the service. You can then direct port 80 of your ELB to port 8080 of the service. With this additional listener in place, the setup should function correctly.",

First, I set up a `ClusterIssuer` to manage certificate issuance through Let's Encrypt. \n\nNext, I created a fallback `Ingress` resource to handle all subdomains, which will serve as the certificate generator. In the `tls` section, I specified both the wildcard and the base domain to ensure the certificate is valid for both subdomains and the main domain.\n\nOnce this is configured, any requests to your domain will be directed to \"some-default-service,\" and cert-manager will automatically issue a new certificate upon creating the fallback ingress. \n\nIf you need to redirect a specific subdomain to a different service, you can create another `Ingress` resource for that subdomain, pointing to the existing certificate secret. \n\nKeep in mind that the certificate secret is namespace-specific. If you need to use the certificate in another namespace, you can either copy the secret (noting that cert-manager won't renew it automatically) or recreate the fallback ingress in each namespace for automatic renewal. \n\nI hope this information is helpful to someone out there!

            "helm is optimized to load as many resources into kubernetes as fast as possible.\nby design, kubernetes can take an entire set of manifests and bring them all\nonline (this is called the reconciliation loop).but there's a difference with crds.for a crd, the declaration must be registered before any resources of that crds\nkind(s) can be used. and the registration process sometimes takes a few seconds.method 1: let  helm  do it for youwith the arrival of helm 3, we removed the old  crd-install  hooks for a more\nsimple methodology. there is now a special directory called  crds  that you can\ncreate in your chart to hold your crds. these crds are not templated, but will\nbe installed by default when running a  helm install  for the chart. if the crd\nalready exists, it will be skipped with a warning. if you wish to skip the crd\ninstallation step, you can pass the  --skip-crds  flag.some caveats (and explanations)there is no support at this time for upgrading or deleting crds using helm. this\nwas an explicit decision after much community discussion due to the danger for\nunintentional data loss. furthermore, there is currently no community consensus\naround how to handle crds and their lifecycle. as this evolves, helm will add\nsupport for those use cases.the  --dry-run  flag of  helm install  and  helm upgrade  is not currently\nsupported for crds. the purpose of \"dry run\" is to validate that the output of\nthe chart will actually work if sent to the server. but crds are a modification\nof the server's behavior. helm cannot install the crd on a dry run, so the\ndiscovery client will not know about that custom resource (cr), and validation\nwill fail. you can alternatively move the crds to their own chart or use  helm template  instead.another important point to consider in the discussion around crd support is how\nthe rendering of templates is handled. one of the distinct disadvantages of the\n crd-install  method used in helm 2 was the inability to properly validate\ncharts due to changing api availability (a crd is actually adding another\navailable api to your kubernetes cluster). if a chart installed a crd,  helm  no\nlonger had a valid set of api versions to work against. this is also the reason\nbehind removing templating support from crds. with the new  crds  method of crd\ninstallation, we now ensure that  helm  has completely valid information about\nthe current state of the cluster.method 2: separate chartsanother way to do this is to put the crd definition in one chart, and then put\nany resources that use that crd in  another  chart.in this method, each chart must be installed separately. however, this workflow\nmay be more useful for cluster operators who have admin access to a clusterprev ← pods and podtemplates next role-based access control →"

Your application must handle the initialization of the shared-data directory if it starts off empty.\n\nFor standard database containers, this is usually not an issue, as they often initiate with an `initdb` type command that sets up the necessary file structure. Similarly, if you're using a persistent volume for caching or as an upload space, this behavior is not problematic.\n\nIn the scenario you described, where one container needs to have a copy of files from another, a persistent volume is not necessary. Instead, you can utilize an `emptyDir` volume that both containers can share, along with an init container to copy the required data into that volume. It's important not to mount anything over the application content.\n\nThis setup can be implemented as follows (in practice, you would typically use a deployment):\n\nWith this configuration, it's also not mandatory for the two containers to run within the same pod; you could have one deployment for the back-end service and another for the nginx server, which would start by copying data from the back-end image.\n\nThe example provided in the Kubernetes documentation for configuring pod initialization is quite similar, but it retrieves the nginx content from an external source.",

        "generated_response": "```bash\nkubectl expose pod site-home --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=site-web-service\n```\n\nThis command will create a NodePort service named `site-web-service` that exposes the `site-home` pod on port 80. The `--type=NodePort` option allows external traffic to access the service through a port on each node in the cluster. The `--port` flag specifies the port that the service will expose, while `--target-port` indicates the port on the pod that the service should forward traffic to. \n\nMake sure that the `site-home` pod is running and ready to accept traffic on the specified target port. If you encounter any issues, check the pod's status and logs for troubleshooting.",
        "reference_answer": "```yaml\nkubectl expose pod site-home --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 --target-port=80\n```\n\n### Explanation\nYou can indeed expose a single pod using a LoadBalancer service, but it's worth noting that this approach is not very practical. Typically, a deployment manages a group of pods, allowing for load balancing across them, which is where the LoadBalancer service shines. However, you can still use it to expose a single pod if needed.\n\nIt's important to remember that your container is exposing port 80, not 8080 (as indicated by `containerPort: 80` in your container specification). Therefore, you should specify `--target-port=80` in your service command. If you only provide the `--port=8080` flag, Kubernetes will assume that the target port is the same as the port specified, which may lead to confusion.\n\nTo verify the service you created, you can run:\n```bash\nkubectl get svc site-home -o yaml\n```\nThis will show you the service configuration, including the `spec.ports` section, where you should see the `targetPort` reflecting the correct port.\n\nAfter properly exposing your pod with the command:\n```bash\nkubectl expose pod site-home --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 --target-port=80\n```\nYou should see an output similar to:\n```\n- nodePort: 31181\n  port: 8080\n  protocol: TCP\n  targetPort: 80\n```\n\nWhen you run `kubectl get services`, you should see something like:\n```\nNAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE\nsite-home   LoadBalancer <cluster-ip>   <external-ip> 8080:31188/TCP   4m42s\n```\n\nYou can then access your application by navigating to `http://<external-ip>:8080` in your browser or using `curl http://<external-ip>:8080`.\n\nKeep in mind that this setup is most effective in a cloud environment that can provide a real load balancer. In Minikube, a LoadBalancer service will actually create a NodePort service since it cannot provision a real load balancer. Your application will then be accessible on your Minikube VM's IP address at a randomly selected port in the range of 30000-32767 (for example, port 31181).\n\nRegarding your question about using a shared volume:\n\nIf you have a shared volume, you cannot use a Deployment; you would need to use Pods (or possibly StatefulSets). The `emptyDir` volume type cannot be shared between different pods, even if they are scheduled on the same node. It is only shared between containers within the same pod. If you want to use a Deployment, you will need to consider a different storage solution, such as a PersistentVolume.\n\nAdditionally, I noticed an error in your command:\n```bash\nkubectl expose pod site-web --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080\n```\nYou are trying to expose a non-existing pod, as your pod's name is actually `site-home`, not `site-web`. The name `site-web` refers to one of the containers within your `site-home` pod. Remember, you are exposing the pod, not the containers.\n\nIf you change the port from 80 to 8080 but still encounter the error:\n```bash\nkubectl expose pod site-home --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080\n```\nYou may see an error message indicating that the pod has no labels and cannot be exposed. This means your pod lacks the necessary labels for the service to select it. You need to define at least one label in your pod definition. Adding a simple label like `name: site-web` under the pod's metadata section should resolve the issue. Your pod definition might look like this:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: site-home\n  labels:\n    name: site-web\nspec:\n...\n```\n\nNow, you can even provide this label as a selector in your service, although it should be handled automatically if you omit the `--selector` flag:\n```bash\nkubectl expose pod site-home --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 --target-port=80 --selector=name=site-web\n```\n\nRemember, in Minikube, a real load balancer cannot be created, and instead, a NodePort service will be created. You can check which port your application is available on by running `kubectl get svc`.\n\nIf you receive an error stating that the pod `site-web` is not found, it indicates that you are trying to expose a non-existing pod. Ensure that you are using the correct pod name.\n\nLastly, if you expose a port from a container, that port is automatically exposed for the pod as well. All ports defined in the container specification are exposed by the pod.",

To achieve your objective, you need to create two Ingress resources initially without any restrictions. The first Ingress, named `ingress-test`, will handle requests to the `/service-mapping` path.\n\nNext, you need to create a secret for authentication as outlined in the documentation. You can create the `htpasswd` file using the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ htpasswd -c auth foo\nnew password: <bar>\nnew password:\nre-type new password:\nadding password for user foo\n```\n\nAfter creating the `htpasswd` file, you can create the secret with the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ kubectl create secret generic basic-auth --from-file=auth\nsecret \"basic-auth\" created\n```\n\nThen, you will create a second Ingress that requires authentication for specific paths. This Ingress, named `ingress-with-auth`, will use the previously created secret for basic authentication:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress-with-auth\n  annotations:\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: basic-auth\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-realm: \"authentication required - foo\"\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: host.host.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /admin\n        backend:\n          serviceName: service_name\n          servicePort: 80\n```\n\nAccording to Sedooe's answer, there may be some issues with this solution.",

Rename your Zookeeper service in the `zookeeper-service.yaml` file from `zookeeper-svc` to `zookeeper`, as shown in the YAML above.\n   \n2. Alternatively, you can keep the service name as `zookeeper-svc` and update the Kafka configuration to connect to `zookeeper-svc` instead of `zookeeper`.\n\nIt's worth noting that while your minimal example successfully reproduces the issue (thank you for providing it!), the pod is running without errors. However, it still shows an error: `java.io.IOException: can't resolve address: kafka:9092`, which is related to a different issue (the service not covering the Kafka deployment) and is beyond the scope of this discussion.",

To resolve this, you need to create an EFS access point for each pod that requires a persistent volume, allowing access for a specified user. These access points should be specified in the persistent volumes, and a suitable security context must be applied to run the pods as the corresponding user.\n\nTo implement this, create two EFS access points as shown above. After that, update your persistent volumes with the following configuration:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolume\nmetadata:\n  name: prometheusalertmanager\nspec:\n  capacity:\n    storage: 2Gi\n  volumeMode: Filesystem\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain\n  storageClassName: efs-sc\n  csi:\n    driver: efs.csi.aws.com\n    volumeHandle: fs-ec0e1234::fsap-<hex02>\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolume\nmetadata:\n  name: prometheusserver\nspec:\n  capacity:\n    storage: 8Gi\n  volumeMode: Filesystem\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain\n  storageClassName: efs-sc\n  csi:\n    driver: efs.csi.aws.com\n    volumeHandle: fs-ec0e1234::fsap-<hex01>\n```\n\nNext, reinstall Prometheus using Helm with the appropriate storage class settings. After installation, you can check the pod descriptions to determine which container requires a specific security context. Finally, apply the security context to run the pods with the correct `uid` and `gid` as shown below:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: myrelease-helm-02-prometheus-alertmanager\nspec:\n  securityContext:\n    runAsUser: 501\n    runAsGroup: 501\n    fsGroup: 501\n  volumes:\n    - name: prometheusalertmanager\n  containers:\n    - name: prometheusalertmanager\n      image: jimmidyson/configmap-reload:v0.4.0\n      securityContext:\n        runAsUser: 501\n        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: myrelease-helm-02-prometheus-server\nspec:\n  securityContext:\n    runAsUser: 500\n    runAsGroup: 500\n    fsGroup: 500\n  volumes:\n    - name: prometheusserver\n  containers:\n    - name: prometheusserver\n      image: jimmidyson/configmap-reload:v0.4.0\n      securityContext:\n        runAsUser: 500\n        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false\n```",

You may have either defined an ingress class that is annotated as the default to use, or this could be the reason why your ingress is not functioning correctly at the moment. An ingress class essentially categorizes which controller is responsible for serving and managing the ingress, which is crucial in a cluster that may have multiple ingress controllers, each with its own rules and configurations. \n\nDepending on the Kubernetes version, the ingress class can be specified using an annotation on the ingress (prior to v1.18), as shown in the example above. Alternatively, it can be defined as a separate resource and referenced within the ingress, as detailed in the documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class). \n\nEven in the latest versions of Kubernetes, the older annotation may still be supported, depending on the ingress controller in use. If you're uncertain about which ingress class to utilize, it should be defined by the controller you are using. You likely chose one during installation or are using the default, which is often nginx.",

There is an official guide that provides a detailed walkthrough on how to implement HPA and its scaling capabilities: [Kubernetes HPA Walkthrough](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#walkthrough).\n\nThe scaling algorithm used by HPA is defined as follows:\n\n```\ndesiredReplicas = ceil[currentReplicas * (currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue)]\n```\n\nFor instance, an example of an autoscaling configuration can be represented in a YAML manifest as shown above. \n\nIt's important to note that HPA evaluates both metrics and selects the one that results in the highest desired replicas. \n\nIn response to a comment I made earlier, I believe there was a misunderstanding. While it is acceptable to \"scale up when CPU >= 90,\" it may not be feasible to specify \"scale down when CPU <= 70\" due to the logic behind the formula. The scaling behavior would be more accurately described as: scale up when CPU >= 90 and scale down when CPU <= 45.\n\nThis example may not be universally applicable in all scenarios. For instance, if the HPA is set to an average utilization of 75%, the following calculations can be made (with a default tolerance of 0.1):\n\n- For 2 replicas:\n  - Scale-up (by 1) occurs when the current metric value is >= 80%:\n    ```\n    x = ceil[2 * (80/75)], x = ceil[2.13] = 3\n    ```\n  - Scale-down (by 1) occurs when the current metric value is <= 33%:\n    ```\n    x = ceil[2 * (33/75)], x = ceil[0.88] = 1\n    ```\n\n- For 8 replicas:\n  - Scale-up (by 1) occurs when the current metric value is >= 76%:\n    ```\n    x = ceil[8 * (76/75)], x = ceil[8.10] = 9\n    ```\n  - Scale-down (by 1) occurs when the current metric value is <= 64%:\n    ```\n    x = ceil[8 * (64/75)], x = ceil[6.82] = 7\n    ```\n\nFollowing this example, if there are 8 replicas and the current metric value is at 55 (with the desired metric value set to 75), the HPA should scale down to 6 replicas.\n\nFor further insights into the decision-making process of HPA, including reasons for not scaling, you can run the following command:\n\n```\n$ kubectl describe hpa hpa-name\n```\n\nIn Kubernetes version 1.18 and later, HPA scaling procedures can be customized with the introduction of configurable scaling behavior. The v2beta2 API allows you to define scaling behavior through the `behavior` field, specifying separate configurations for scaling up and down. You can also set a stabilization window to prevent rapid fluctuations in the number of replicas. More information can be found in the official documentation: [Kubernetes HPA Configurable Scaling Behavior](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-configurable-scaling-behavior).\n\nI recommend utilizing the newly introduced fields like `behavior` and `stabilizationWindowSeconds` to fine-tune your workload according to your specific requirements. Additionally, I suggest consulting the EKS documentation for more references, support for metrics, and examples.",

If you need to diagnose a specific certificate, the `kubectl describe certificate certificate_name -n your_namespace` command will provide detailed information, including the name of the associated certificate request. You can then further investigate that request with `kubectl describe certificaterequest certificate_request_name -n your_namespace`. \n\nFor troubleshooting challenges, the command `kubectl describe challenges --all-namespaces` can be helpful. In my case, I found that changing from `clusterissuer` to `issuer` resolved my issue, as noted in the comment.

You can verify this by running the following command:\n```bash\n$ kubectl explain statefulset.spec.template.spec --api-version apps/v1\n```\nThis will show you that `imagePullSecrets` is an optional list of references to secrets within the same namespace that can be used for pulling images specified in the pod template. If provided, these secrets will be utilized by the image puller implementations. For instance, only Docker config type secrets are recognized in the case of Docker. For more details, you can refer to the Kubernetes documentation: [Specifying imagePullSecrets on a Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod).\n\nTo test this, you can create a sample StatefulSet in your cluster using the following command:\n```bash\n$ kubectl create -f - <<EOF\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: StatefulSet\nmetadata:\n  name: web\nspec:\n  serviceName: \"nginx\"\n  replicas: 2\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      imagePullSecrets:\n      - name: your-pull-secret-name\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n          name: web\nEOF\n```\n\nAfter creating the StatefulSet, you can check if the pod has the specified `imagePullSecrets` by running:\n```bash\n$ kubectl get pod web-0 -o yaml | grep -e '^[[:space:]]+imagePullSecrets:' -A1\n```\nThis should show you the `imagePullSecrets` configuration for the pod.",

While it can handle some level of merging, there isn't a direct one-to-one relationship between services as target groups and ingress as ALB. Therefore, it's essential to be cautious and aware of the contents of each ingress object. \n\nOnce I consolidated all my ingress configurations into a single object definition, I was able to achieve the desired functionality. The default action is set by specifying the service name and service port directly under the `spec`. Since I am using subdomains and paths won't work for my use case, I omitted the path and instead relied on the hostname as a condition. \n\nThe end result was that the ALB rules were configured exactly as I wanted: the default action returns a 503 fixed response, all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS, and traffic is directed to target groups based on the host header.",

In my setup, I utilized an NGINX image that serves a default landing page on port 80. With the provided Ingress rule, it is possible to access this page on both ports 80 and 443. \n\nThe only modification I made to your Ingress was the removal of the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: false`, as it is stated in the documentation that SSL passthrough is disabled by default, making this specification unnecessary.\n\nI also used the same TLS secret as you did, created with the following commands:\n```bash\n$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj \"/cn=nginxsvc/o=nginxsvc\"\n$ kubectl create secret tls tls-secret --key tls.key --cert tls.crt\n```\n\nIn your inquiry, it seems you are attempting to access your Ingress using the IP address 192.168.0.210, which is actually the service IP and not the Ingress IP. If you are using a cloud-managed Kubernetes service, you can find your Ingress IP by running:\n```bash\n$ kubectl get ingresses nginx\n```\n\nIf you are operating on bare metal without a load balancer solution like MetalLB, you may notice that your Ingress-NGINX service will have an external IP status of \"pending\" indefinitely. You can manually assign an external IP to your Ingress-NGINX service similar to how you did with your service:\n```bash\n$ kubectl get service -n ingress-nginx\n```\n\nAfter making this change, your Ingress will reflect the same IP as defined in your Ingress service:\n```bash\n$ kubectl get ingress nginx\n```\n\nYou can then test the Ingress with:\n```bash\n$ curl -kl https://<your-ingress-ip>/nginx --verbose\n```\n\nLastly, it appears that there is no direct method to manually set the \"external IPs\" for the Ingress as you can for the service. If you have any insights on this, please share. For production environments, MetalLB would be the optimal choice. If this is for a lab setup, you can add your node's public IP (which you can obtain by running `kubectl get nodes -o wide`) to your NGINX Ingress controller by modifying the spec:\n```yaml\nspec:\n  externalIPs:\n  - 192.168.0.210\n```\n\nCreate a file named `ingress-nginx-svc-patch.yaml` with the above content and apply the changes using:\n```bash\nkubectl patch service ingress-nginx-controller -n kube-system --patch \"$(cat ingress-nginx-svc-patch.yaml)\"\n```\n\nAs a result, you should see:\n```bash\n$ kubectl get service -n kube-system ingress-nginx-controller\n```",

            "official document: nginx supports load balancing by client-server mapping based on [consistent hashing](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#hash) for a given key. the key can contain text, variables or any combination thereof. this feature allows for request stickiness other than client ip or cookies. the [ketama](https://www.last.fm/user/rj/journal/2007/04/10/rz_libketama_-_a_consistent_hashing_algo_for_memcache_clients) consistent hashing method will be used which ensures only a few keys would be remapped to different servers on upstream group changes.  there is a special mode of upstream hashing called subset. in this mode, upstream servers are grouped into subsets, and stickiness works by mapping keys to a subset instead of individual upstream servers. specific server is chosen uniformly at random from the selected sticky subset. it provides a balance between stickiness and load distribution.  to enable consistent hashing for a backend:  `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by`: the nginx variable, text value or any combination thereof to use for consistent hashing. for example: `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: \"$request_uri\"` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: \"$request_uri$host\"` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: \"${request_uri}-text-value\"` to consistently hash upstream requests by the current request uri.  \"subset\" hashing can be enabled setting `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by-subset`: \"true\". this maps requests to subset of nodes instead of a single one. `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by-subset-size` determines the size of each subset (default 3).  please check the [chashsubset](../../examples/chashsubset/deployment.yaml) example. huawei cloud: the native nginx supports multiple load balancing rules, including weighted round robin and ip hash. nginx ingress supports load balancing by using consistent hashing based on the native nginx capabilities. by default, the ip hash method supported by nginx uses the linear hash space. the backend server is selected based on the hash value of the ip address. however, when this method is used to add or delete a node, all ip addresses need to be hashed again and then routed again. as a result, a large number of sessions are lost or the cache becomes invalid. therefore, consistent hashing is introduced to nginx ingress to solve this problem. consistent hashing is a special hash algorithm, which constructs a ring hash space to replace the common linear hash space. when a node is added or deleted, only the target route is migrated clockwise, and other routes do not need to be changed. in this way, rerouting can be reduced as much as possible, resolving the load balancing issue caused by dynamic node addition and deletion. if a consistent hashing rule is configured, the newly added server will share the load of all other servers. similarly, when a server is removed, all other servers can share the load of the removed server. this balances the load among nodes in the cluster and prevents the avalanche effect caused by the breakdown of a node. configuring a consistent hashing rule nginx ingress can use the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioupstream-hash-by annotation to configure consistent hashing rules. the following is an example create a yaml file named ingress-test.yaml. the file name can be customized. vi ingress-test.yaml for clusters of v1.23 or later apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata name ingress-test namespace default annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioupstream-hash-by request_uri # perform hashing based on the request uri. spec rules - host http paths - path backend service name your_service_name # replace it with the name of your target service. port number your_service_port # replace it with the port number of your target service. property ingress.beta.kubernetes.iourl-match-mode starts_with pathtype implementationspecific ingressclassname nginx for clusters of v1.21 or earlier apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata name ingress-test"

Use the following command to retrieve the logs:\n\n```bash\nkubectl logs -n ingress-nginx ingress_nginx_controller_pod_name\n```\n\nThe output will resemble the following (depending on your specific use case):\n\n```\nclient_ip - - [12/May/2020:11:06:56 +0000] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 238 \"-\" \"redacted\" 430 0.003 [default-ubuntu-service-ubuntu-port] [] 10.48.0.13:8080 276 0.003 200\nclient_ip - - [12/May/2020:11:06:56 +0000] \"GET /assets/styles/style.css HTTP/1.1\" 200 22 \"http://server_ip/\" \"redacted\" 348 0.002 [default-ubuntu-service-ubuntu-port] [] 10.48.0.13:8080 22 0.002 200\n```\n\nThese logs will help you determine if the requests are being processed correctly by the nginx-ingress controller and where they are being directed. Additionally, you can refer to the documentation at kubernetes.github.io: ingress-nginx: ingress-path-matching, which explains how ingress matches paths using regular expressions.\n\nYou can also experiment with ingress by following the steps below:\n\n1. Deploy the nginx-ingress controller.\n2. Create a pod and a service.\n3. Run an example application.\n4. Create an ingress resource.\n5. Test the setup.\n6. Rewrite the example as needed.\n\nTo deploy the nginx-ingress controller, follow the official documentation available at kubernetes.github.io: ingress-nginx.\n\nFor testing purposes, here is an example definition of a pod and a service:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: ubuntu-deployment\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: ubuntu\n  replicas: 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: ubuntu\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: ubuntu\n        image: ubuntu\n        command:\n        - sleep\n        - \"infinity\"\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: ubuntu-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: ubuntu\n  ports:\n    - name: ubuntu-port\n      port: 8080\n      targetPort: 8080\n      nodePort: 30080\n  type: NodePort\n```\n\nNext, create a basic `index.html` file along with a CSS file to simulate the request process. You can create these files inside the pod or copy them over. The file structure should look like this:\n\n```\nindex.html\nassets/styles/style.css\n```\n\nThe content of `index.html` should be:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assets/styles/style.css\">\n  <title>Document</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <h1>Hi</h1>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nPay special attention to the line:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assets/styles/style.css\">\n```\n\nThe `style.css` file should contain:\n\n```css\nh1 {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nYou can run the above page using Python:\n\n```bash\napt update && apt install -y python3\npython3 -m http.server 8080\n```\n\nNow, create an ingress resource configured to use the nginx-ingress controller:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-ingress-example\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: \n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: ubuntu-service\n            port:\n              name: ubuntu-port\n```\n\nAfter applying the above resource, you can start testing. Access the external IP address associated with your ingress resource in your browser. As mentioned earlier, you can check the logs of the nginx-ingress controller pod to see how it handles requests.\n\nIf you run the command `python3 -m http.server 8080`, you will also see logs like:\n\n```\n10.48.0.16 - - [12/May/2020 11:06:56] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n10.48.0.16 - - [12/May/2020 11:06:56] \"GET /assets/styles/style.css HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n```\n\nFor a path rewrite example, you can modify the ingress resource as follows:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-ingress-example\n  annotations:\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx\n    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: \n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /product/(.*)\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: ubuntu-service\n            port:\n              name: ubuntu-port\n```\n\nThe changes made include:\n\n- Adding the annotation for the rewrite target: `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1`\n- Modifying the path to: `/product/(.*)`\n\nIn this scenario, when the browser sends a request to `/product/`, the controller rewrites it to `/`, and the pod receives the request as `/`. \n\nLogs from the nginx-ingress controller will show:\n\n```\nclient_ip - - [12/May/2020:11:33:23 +0000] \"GET /product/ HTTP/1.1\" 200 228 \"-\" \"redacted\" 438 0.002 [default-ubuntu-service-ubuntu-port] [] 10.48.0.13:8080 276 0.001 200\nclient_ip - - [12/May/2020:11:33:23 +0000] \"GET /product/assets/styles/style.css HTTP/1.1\" 200 22 \"http://server_ip/product/\" \"redacted\" 364 0.002 [default-ubuntu-service-ubuntu-port] [] 10.48.0.13:8080 22 0.002 200\n```\n\nAnd the logs from the pod will show:\n\n```\n10.48.0.16 - - [12/May/2020 11:33:23] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n10.48.0.16 - - [12/May/2020 11:33:23] \"GET /assets/styles/style.css HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n```\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions regarding this setup.",

The solution I provided earlier remains valid for sharing a replacement configuration across multiple overlays. However, there are some inaccuracies in your replacement syntax: you cannot directly target `spec.template.spec.volumes.name` because `volumes` is a list and does not have a name attribute. Instead, you should use a selector in the `[name=value]` format to target list elements, like this:\n\n```yaml\nreplacements:\n  - source:\n      name: test_secret\n      kind: Secret\n    targets:\n      - select:\n          kind: Deployment\n          name: service\n        fieldPaths:\n          - spec.template.spec.volumes.[name=placeholder_value].name\n```\n\nA `kustomization.yaml` can only apply transformations (such as labels, patches, and replacements) to resources that it generates. Therefore, if you want a transformation to affect all resources, it must be applied in the \"outermost\" kustomization. This means you cannot place something in a \"base\" that will modify resources created in your overlays. \n\nHowever, there's no need to worry; components allow you to reuse kustomization fragments. By moving your replacement configuration into a component, you can achieve the desired behavior. For instance, consider a project structure with a base and two overlays:\n\n```\n.\n├── base\n│   ├── deployment.yaml\n│   └── kustomization.yaml\n├── components\n│   └── replace-username-password\n│       └── kustomization.yaml\n└── overlay\n    ├── env1\n    │   └── kustomization.yaml\n    └── env2\n        └── kustomization.yaml\n```\n\nThe `base/deployment.yaml` file looks like this:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: example\nspec:\n  replicas: 2\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: example\n          image: docker.io/alpine:latest\n          command:\n            - sleep\n            - inf\n          env:\n            - name: user_name\n              value: update-via-replacement\n            - name: user_password\n              value: update-via-replacement\n```\n\nAnd the `base/kustomization.yaml` file is structured as follows:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\ncommonLabels:\n  app: replacement-example\n\nresources:\n  - deployment.yaml\n\nsecretGenerator:\n  - name: example\n    literals:\n      - password=secret\n\nconfigMapGenerator:\n  - name: example\n    literals:\n      - username=alice\n```\n\nThis base directory results in a deployment, a secret, and a config map. In both overlays, `env1` and `env2`, I want to apply the same replacement configuration, so I place that in `components/replace-username-password/kustomization.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Component\n\nreplacements:\n  - source:\n      kind: ConfigMap\n      name: example\n      fieldPath: data.username\n    targets:\n      - select:\n          kind: Deployment\n          name: example\n        fieldPaths:\n          - spec.template.spec.containers.[name=example].env.[name=user_name].value\n  - source:\n      kind: Secret\n      name: example\n      fieldPath: data.password\n    targets:\n      - select:\n          kind: Deployment\n          name: example\n        fieldPaths:\n          - spec.template.spec.containers.[name=example].env.[name=user_password].value\n```\n\nNow, in `overlays/env1/kustomization.yaml`, I can utilize this component:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\ncommonLabels:\n  envName: env1\n\nresources:\n  - ../../base\n\ncomponents:\n  - ../../components/replace-username-password\n```\n\nThe same applies to `overlays/env2/kustomization.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\ncommonLabels:\n  envName: env2\n\nresources:\n  - ../../base\n\ncomponents:\n  - ../../components/replace-username-password\n```",

            "the first template we are going to create will be a  configmap . in kubernetes,\na configmap is simply an object for storing configuration data. other things,\nlike pods, can access the data in a configmap.because configmaps are basic resources, they make a great starting point for us.let's begin by creating a file called  mychart/templates/configmap.yaml :apiversion :   v1 \n kind :   configmap \n metadata : \n    name :   mychart-configmap \n data : \n    myvalue :   \"hello world\"tip:  template names do not follow a rigid naming pattern. however, we\nrecommend using the extension  .yaml  for yaml files and  .tpl  for helpers.the yaml file above is a bare-bones configmap, having the minimal necessary\nfields. by virtue of the fact that this file is in the  mychart/templates/ \ndirectory, it will be sent through the template engine.it is just fine to put a plain yaml file like this in the  mychart/templates/ \ndirectory. when helm reads this template, it will simply send it to kubernetes\nas-is.with this simple template, we now have an installable chart. and we can install\nit like this:$  helm install full-coral ./mychart\n name: full-coral\n last deployed: tue nov  1 17:36:01 2016\n namespace: default\n status: deployed\n revision: 1\n test suite: noneusing helm, we can retrieve the release and see the actual template that was\nloaded.$  helm get manifest full-coral\n \n ---\n #  source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml\n apiversion: v1\n kind: configmap\n metadata:\n   name: mychart-configmap\n data:\n   myvalue: \"hello world\"the  helm get manifest  command takes a release name ( full-coral ) and prints\nout all of the kubernetes resources that were uploaded to the server. each file\nbegins with  ---  to indicate the start of a yaml document, and then is followed\nby an automatically generated comment line that tells us what template file\ngenerated this yaml document.from there on, we can see that the yaml data is exactly what we put in our\n configmap.yaml  file.now we can uninstall our release:  helm uninstall full-coral .adding a simple template callhard-coding the  name:  into a resource is usually considered to be bad\npractice. names should be unique to a release. so we might want to generate a\nname field by inserting the release name.tip:  the  name:  field is limited to 63 characters because of limitations to\nthe dns system. for that reason, release names are limited to 53 characters.\nkubernetes 1.3 and earlier limited to only 24 characters (thus 14 character\nnames).let's alter  configmap.yaml  accordingly.apiversion :   v1 \n kind :   configmap \n metadata : \n    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap \n data : \n    myvalue :   \"hello world\"the big change comes in the value of the  name:  field, which is now\n {{ .release.name }}-configmap .a template directive is enclosed in  {{  and  }}  blocks.the template directive  {{ .release.name }}  injects the release name into the\ntemplate. the values that are passed into a template can be thought of as\n namespaced objects , where a dot ( . ) separates each namespaced element.the leading dot before  release  indicates that we start with the top-most\nnamespace for this scope (we'll talk about scope in a bit). so we could read\n .release.name  as \"start at the top namespace, find the  release  object, then\nlook inside of it for an object called  name \".the  release  object is one of the built-in objects for helm, and we'll cover it\nin more depth later. but for now, it is sufficient to say that this will display\nthe release name that the library assigns to our release.now when we install our resource, we'll immediately see the result of using this\ntemplate directive:$  helm install clunky-serval ./mychart\n name: clunky-serval\n last deployed: tue nov  1 17:45:37 2016\n namespace: default\n status: deployed\n revision: 1\n test suite: noneyou can run  helm get manifest clunky-serval  to see the entire generated yaml.note that the configmap inside kubernetes name is  clunky-serval-configmap \ninstead of  mychart-configmap  previously.at this point, we've"

            "a service is an object  (the same way that a pod or a configmap is an object).\nyou can create, view or modify service definitions using the kubernetes api.\nusually you use a tool such as kubectl to make those api calls for you.\nfor example, suppose you have a set of pods that each listen on tcp port 9376 and are labelled as\n\napp.kubernetes.io/name=myapp\n\n.\nyou can define a service to publish that tcp listener: service/simple-service.yaml \n\napiversion: v1\nkind: service\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp\n  ports:\n    - protocol: tcp\n      port: 80\n      targetport: 9376\n\napplying this manifest creates a new service named \"my-service\" with the default clusterip service type .\nthe service targets tcp port 9376 on any pod with the\n\napp.kubernetes.io/name: myapp\n\nlabel.\nkubernetes assigns this service an ip address (the cluster ip ), that is used by the virtual ip address mechanism.\nfor more details on that mechanism, read virtual ips and service proxies .\nthe controller for that service continuously scans for pods that match its selector, and then makes any necessary updates to the set of endpointslices for the service.\nthe name of a service object must be a valid rfc 1035 label name .\nnote: a service can map any incoming port to a targetport.\nby default and for convenience, the targetport is set to the same value as the port field.\nport definitions port definitions in pods have names, and you can reference these names in the targetport attribute of a service.\nfor example, we can bind the targetport of the service to the pod port in the following way:\n\napiversion: v1\nkind: pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\n  labels:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx:stable\n    ports:\n      - containerport: 80\n        name: http-web-svc\n\n---\napiversion: v1\nkind: service\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-service\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy\n  ports:\n  - name: name-of-service-port\n    protocol: tcp\n    port: 80\n    targetport: http-web-svc\n\nthis works even if there is a mixture of pods in the service using a single configured name, with the same network protocol available via different port numbers.\nthis offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving your services.\nfor example, you can change the port numbers that pods expose in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.\nthe default protocol for services is tcp ; you can also use any other supported protocol .\nbecause many services need to expose more than one port, kubernetes supports multiple port definitions  for a single service.\neach port definition can have the same protocol, or a different one.\nservices without selectors services most commonly abstract access to kubernetes pods thanks to the selector, but when used with a corresponding set of endpointslices  objects and without a selector, the service can abstract other kinds of backends, including ones that run outside the cluster.\nfor example: you want to have an external database cluster in production, but in your test environment you use your own databases.\nyou want to point your service to a service in a different namespace  or on another cluster.\nyou are migrating a workload to kubernetes.\nwhile evaluating the approach, you run only a portion of your backends in kubernetes.\nin any of these scenarios you can define a service without specifying a selector to match pods.\nfor example:\n\napiversion: v1\nkind: service\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      protocol: tcp\n      port: 80\n      targetport: 9376\n\nbecause this service has no selector, the corresponding endpointslice (and legacy endpoints) objects are not created automatically.\nyou can map the service to the network address and port where it's running, by adding an endpointslice object manually.\nfor example:\n\napiversion: discovery.k8s.io/v1\nkind: endpointslice\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service-1 # by convention, use the name"

If the Pod does not have the label `app: tcserver`, the Service will not be able to route traffic to it, resulting in no endpoints being created. Ensure that the Pod definition includes the label `app: tcserver`.\n\n2. **Correct Labeling**: Update the Pod YAML to include the correct label:\n   ```yaml\n   metadata:\n     labels:\n       app: tcserver\n   ```\n\n### Validation:\n- Confirm that the Pod has the label `app: tcserver` to match the Service selector.\n- Verify that the Service is correctly configured to expose the intended ports. If the issue persists, further investigation into the Pod's status and logs may be necessary.",
        "reference_answer": "```yaml\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: tcserver\n```\n\n### Explanation\nWhen you examine the output of `kubectl describe service`, you'll notice that it isn't linked to any pods:\n\n```\nendpoints:              <none>\n```\n\nThis occurs because the service specification indicates that it should connect to pods labeled with `app: tcserver`:\n\n```yaml\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: tcserver\n```\n\nHowever, in the pod specification's metadata, you haven't defined any labels:\n\n```yaml\nmetadata:\n  name: tcserver\n  namespace: default\n  # labels: {}\n```\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to add the appropriate label to the pod specification:\n\n```yaml\nmetadata:\n  labels:\n    app: tcserver\n```\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that deploying a standalone pod is somewhat uncommon. Typically, pods are managed by a higher-level controller, most frequently a deployment, which is responsible for creating the pods. The deployment specification includes a template for the pod specification, and it's the labels on the pod that are significant for the service.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: tcserver\n  # labels here are useful, but the service doesn't look for them\nspec:\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        # these labels are what the service cares about\n        app: tcserver\n    spec:\n      containers: [...]\n```",

Updated the `apiVersion` to `batch/v1`, which is the correct version for CronJobs as of Kubernetes 1.21 and later.\n2. Ensured that the `kind` is correctly specified as `CronJob`, following Kubernetes naming conventions.\n3. Verified that `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` and `failedJobsHistoryLimit` are correctly cased to match the Kubernetes API specifications.\n\n### Validation:\nMake sure to validate the YAML syntax and confirm that the fields align with the Kubernetes schema for CronJobs. This configuration will limit the history of successful and failed jobs to one each, which is a common practice for managing job history in Kubernetes.",

By modifying the patch to include a placeholder name, as shown above, it resolves the issue. \n\nFor example, if you have a base configuration file `base/cronjob1.yaml` that looks like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: batch/v1\nkind: CronJob\nmetadata:\n  name: cronjob1\nspec:\n  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 2\n  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 5\n  jobTemplate:\n    spec:\n      template:\n        spec:\n          containers:\n          - command:\n            - sleep\n            - 60\n            image: docker.io/alpine:latest\n            name: example\n  schedule: 30 3 * * *\n```\nAnd you use the above patch along with an overlay configuration in `overlay/kustomization.yaml` like this:\n```yaml\napiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1\nkind: Kustomization\nresources:\n- ../base\npatches:\n- path: kubejobhistorylimit.yml\n  target:\n    kind: CronJob\n```\nWhen you run `kustomize build overlay`, the output will be:\n```yaml\napiVersion: batch/v1\nkind: CronJob\nmetadata:\n  name: cronjob2\nspec:\n  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1\n  jobTemplate:\n    spec:\n      template:\n        spec:\n          containers:\n          - command:\n            - sleep\n            - 60\n            image: docker.io/alpine:latest\n            name: example\n  schedule: 30 3 * * *\n  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 1\n```\nThis shows that the two attributes have been updated correctly.",

            "official document: the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity` enables and sets the affinity type in all upstreams of an ingress. this way, a request will always be directed to the same upstream server. the only affinity type available for nginx is `cookie`.  !!! attention if more than one ingress is defined for a host and at least one ingress uses `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: cookie`, then only paths on the ingress using `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity` will use session cookie affinity. all paths defined on other ingresses for the host will be load balanced through the random selection of a backend server.  !!! example     please check the [affinity](../../examples/affinity/cookie/readme.md) example. medium website: sometimes, you may find that your kubernetes application doesnt work properly when you first run more than 1 replica. in my experience, this is most frequently because the application is pod-stateful for example, the application may store session state in memory or is writing data required during subsequent requests to local-storage. an initial request is sent to pod a and the state is initialized and some subsequent request gets sent to pod b which doesnt have access to that state, and as a result the application doesnt behave as desired often, the initial reaction is ok, how can i make all requests for this session go to back to the pod that handled the initial request? kubernetes services support affinity by clientip. if you are accessing your application via an ingress, most ingress controllers will support a feature called session affinity example 1, example 2, example 3, usually using cookies. please dont think, however, that these options are silver bullets! its worth noting that one of the principles of container-based application design is process disposability. containers should be as ephemeral as possible and ready to be replaced by another container instance at any point in time. when for example your containers are storing session state in memory, they cant really be replaced by another container instance at least not without impacting some portion of your active users. there are some really good reasons for this principle. lets look at an example consider the following trivial java servlet import java.io. import java.util. import javax.servlet. import javax.servlet.http. @webservlethelloworld public class helloworldservlet extends httpservlet public static final string lang_param_name lang protected void doposthttpservletrequest request, httpservletresponse response throws servletexception, ioexception httpsession session request.getsession session.setattributelang_param_name, request.getparameterlang_param_name protected void dogethttpservletrequest request, httpservletresponse response throws servletexception, ioexception httpsession session request.getsession printwriter writer response.getwriter writer.printlnlanguage session.getattributelang_param_name on the first post request, the application retrieves the language parameter from the request and stores its value in session state. subsequent get requests associated with this session are expecting the language parameter to be available from the session state, but it will only be there if all requests get routed to the same pod which by default wont be the case if replicas 1 which, if you care at all about the stability of your application, you probably want. service session affinity one option is to implement session affinity on the service kind service apiversion v1 metadata name myservice spec selector app myapp ports - name http protocol tcp port 80 targetport 80 # the following adds session affinity sessionaffinity clientip sessionaffinityconfig clientip timeoutseconds 600 this works when accessing a clusterip service directly, and when using a loadbalancer type service. unfortunately, many highly-available nodeport service and ingress configurations probably wont work by default, because the clientip that the service gets will be the ip of a load-balancer or the ingress controller pods and not that of the cli",

For more details, refer to the Helm documentation on the lookup function: [Helm Lookup Function](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/functions_and_pipelines/#using-the-lookup-function). An example of how to implement this function in a Helm chart can be found here: [Helm Chart Example](https://github.com/sankalp-r/helm-charts-examples/blob/1081ab5a5af3a1c7924c826c5a2bed4c19889daf/sample_chart/templates/_helpers.tpl#l67). \n\nThe secret creation process can be illustrated with the following example file: [Secret YAML Example](https://github.com/sankalp-r/helm-charts-examples/blob/main/sample_chart/templates/secret.yaml). The lookup function checks for the existence of the secret named \"test-secret\" in the specified namespace. If the secret exists, it retrieves the password; if not, it generates a new password.",

If you have three containers in your pod, this results in a total CPU request of 0.3 CPU. The node you are deploying to has 0.68 CPU (680m) already requested by other workloads, with a total allocatable limit of 0.94 CPU (940m). \n\nTo identify which workloads are consuming that 0.68 CPU, you can inspect the pods running on the node. In the GKE console, you can view resource allocations and limits per node, and by clicking on the node, you can access detailed information about the workloads. For instance, you might find that two kube-dns pods are each using 0.26 CPU, among other system pods necessary for cluster operation. The specific workloads you see will vary based on the add-on services you have enabled, such as HTTP load balancing (Ingress) or the Kubernetes dashboard.\n\nYour pod's total CPU request would exceed the node's limit, reaching 0.98 CPU, which is why it cannot start. It's important to note that Kubernetes scheduling is based on the requested CPU for each workload, not the actual usage or limits.\n\nYou have a few options to resolve this issue:\n1. Disable any unnecessary add-on services that are consuming CPU resources.\n2. Increase the CPU resources available to your cluster by either upgrading your node pool to use VMs with more CPU or by adding more nodes to your existing pool. This can be done through the GKE console or the gcloud command line.\n3. Explicitly set lower CPU requests for your containers to override the default values.",

You can refer to this documentation for a complete list of available commands. According to that documentation, the purpose of a job is to create one or more pods and keep retrying their execution until the specified number of successfully terminated pods is reached. After that, the job tracks the successful completions. You cannot simply update the job, as certain fields are not updatable. To achieve your goal, you should delete the current job and create a new one.\n\nI recommend maintaining all your configurations in files. If you encounter issues with configuring job commands, best practices suggest modifying these settings in YAML files and applying them to the cluster. This way, if your deployment fails, you have a backup of your configuration. If you're interested in improving this task, consider the two examples described below:\n\nFirst, I've created several files:\n1. **Job Definition (job.yaml)**:\n```yaml\napiVersion: batch/v1\nkind: Job\nmetadata:\n  name: test1\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: test1\n        image: busybox\n        command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"sleep 300\"]\n        volumeMounts:\n        - name: foo\n          mountPath: \"/script/foo\"\n      volumes:\n      - name: foo\n        configMap:\n          name: my-conf\n          defaultMode: 0755\n      restartPolicy: OnFailure\n```\n2. **Patch File (patch-file.yaml)**:\n```yaml\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: test1\n        image: busybox\n        command: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"echo 'patching test' && sleep 500\"]\n```\n3. **ConfigMap (configmap.yaml)**:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: my-conf\ndata:\n  test: |\n    #!/bin/sh\n    echo \"script test\"\n```\n\nIf you want to automate this process, you can use a plugin.\n\nA plugin is a standalone executable file that begins with `kubectl-`. To install a plugin, simply move its executable file to a location in your PATH. No installation or pre-loading is required. Plugin executables inherit the environment from the `kubectl` binary, and each plugin determines which command path it will implement based on its name.\n\nHere is a file that can replace your job:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nkubectl patch -f job.yaml -p \"$(cat patch-file.yaml)\" --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl replace --force -f - && kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l job-name=test1 && kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l job-name=test1 --no-headers -o custom-columns=\":metadata.name\") -- /bin/sh\n```\n\nThis command uses an additional file (patch-file.yaml) where you can specify your changes for the job. After creating the file, change its permissions and move it:\n```bash\nsudo chmod +x ./kubectl-job\nsudo mv ./kubectl-job /usr/local/bin\n```\n\nNow you can use it:\n```bash\n$ kubectl job\njob.batch \"test1\" deleted\njob.batch/test1 replaced\npod/test1-bdxtm condition met\npod/test1-nh2pv condition met\n```\n\nAs you can see, the job has been replaced (deleted and created).\n\nYou can also use a single-line command, as shown in the example below:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get job test1 -o json | jq \"del(.spec.selector)\" | jq \"del(.spec.template.metadata.labels)\" | kubectl patch -f - --patch '{\"spec\":  {\"template\":  {\"spec\":  {\"containers\": [{\"name\": \"test1\", \"image\": \"busybox\", \"command\": [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\",  \"sleep 200\"]}]} }}}}' --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl replace --force -f -\n```\n\nWith this command, you can manually change your job parameters. Here is the output:\n```\njob.batch \"test1\" deleted\njob.batch/test1 replaced\n```\n\nAs you can see, this solution works as well.",
