    <summary>
    The user has an existing Ingress configuration that works with the deprecated API version `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`. They are attempting to update it to the newer `networking.k8s.io/v1` version but encounter validation errors related to the `backend` fields, specifically `servicename` and `serviceport`, which are not recognized in the new version. The user seeks guidance on how to properly update their Ingress configuration to the latest API version without encountering these errors.

### Explanation
I believe this pull request includes the changes you are inquiring about. The `Ingress` and `IngressClass` resources have transitioned to `networking.k8s.io/v1`. The `Ingress` and `IngressClass` types in the `extensions/v1beta1` and `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API versions are now deprecated and will not be available in version 1.22 and later. Existing objects can still be accessed through the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API. Key changes in the v1 `Ingress` objects (the field names from v1beta1 remain unchanged) include:
* `spec.backend` is now `spec.defaultBackend`
* `serviceName` is now `service.name`
* `servicePort` is now `service.port.name` (for string values)
* `servicePort` is now `service.port.number` (for numeric values)
* The `pathType` no longer has a default value in v1; you must specify ""Exact"", ""Prefix"", or ""ImplementationSpecific"".

Additional updates to the `Ingress` API include:
* Backends can now be either resource or service backends.
* The `path` is no longer required to be a valid regular expression.

If you refer to the documentation for Ingress in version 1.19, the new syntax appears to be as shown above. Unfortunately, I do not have access to a 1.19 cluster to verify this myself, but I believe this is the issue you are encountering.","to update an existing ingress to add a new host, you can update it by editing the resource:

kubectl describe ingress test

namespace:        default
address:          178.91.123.132

  normal   add     35s                loadbalancer-controller  default/test



kubectl edit ingress test

this pops up an editor with the existing configuration in yaml format.
modify it to include the new host:

spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: service1
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /foo
        pathtype: prefix
  - host: bar.baz.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /foo
        pathtype: prefix
..

after you save your changes, kubectl updates the resource in the api server, which tells the ingress controller to reconfigure the load balancer.
verify this:

kubectl describe ingress test

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

### Explanation
You can utilize the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size` to directly set the `max-body-size` option within your Ingress resource, eliminating the need to modify a base ConfigMap. This allows for more granular control over the request body size limits for your application.","official document: for nginx, an 413 error will be returned to the client when the size in a request exceeds the maximum allowed size of the client request body. this size can be configured by the parameter [`client_max_body_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size).  to configure this setting globally for all ingress rules, the `proxy-body-size` value may be set in the [nginx configmap](./configmap.md#proxy-body-size). to use custom values in an ingress rule define these annotation:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 8m ``` loft blog: this rule can be used to set the maximum size of the body in a request. if the body exceeds the maximum size set, nginx will return a 413 error to the client. the body size can be configured by using the following nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioproxy-body-size 8m copy heres an example apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata name test-ingress annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioproxy-body-size 8m spec rules - http paths - path testpath backend servicename test copy","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","official document: nginx supports load balancing by client-server mapping based on [consistent hashing](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#hash) for a given key. the key can contain text, variables or any combination thereof. this feature allows for request stickiness other than client ip or cookies. the [ketama](https://www.last.fm/user/rj/journal/2007/04/10/rz_libketama_-_a_consistent_hashing_algo_for_memcache_clients) consistent hashing method will be used which ensures only a few keys would be remapped to different servers on upstream group changes.  there is a special mode of upstream hashing called subset. in this mode, upstream servers are grouped into subsets, and stickiness works by mapping keys to a subset instead of individual upstream servers. specific server is chosen uniformly at random from the selected sticky subset. it provides a balance between stickiness and load distribution.  to enable consistent hashing for a backend:  `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by`: the nginx variable, text value or any combination thereof to use for consistent hashing. for example: `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: ""$request_uri""` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: ""$request_uri$host""` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: ""${request_uri}-text-value""` to consistently hash upstream requests by the current request uri.

### Explanation
For a complete overview of authentication, please consult the official Kubernetes documentation on authentication and authorization. It is advisable to use an identity provider for Kubernetes, such as OpenID Connect, for user authentication. If you are utilizing GKE or ACS, you can integrate with their respective identity and access management frameworks. For self-hosted Kubernetes setups (like those using Kops), CoreOS/Dex can be employed to connect with LDAP or OAuth2 identity providers. A detailed two-part article on SSO for Kubernetes serves as a good reference. 

Kops (version 1.10 and later) now features built-in authentication support, which simplifies the integration with AWS IAM as an identity provider for AWS users. There are also several open-source CLI clients available for Dex, such as nordstrom/kubelogin and pusher/k8s-auth-example. 

If you are seeking a quick and easy (though not the most secure or manageable in the long run) method to get started, you can utilize service accounts with two options for specialized policies to control access. It is important to note that since version 1.6, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is strongly recommended, and this response does not cover RBAC setup. 

Additionally, there is an outdated (2017-2018) guide by Bitnami on user setup with RBAC that may still be relevant. The steps to enable service account access are outlined above, and depending on your cluster configuration, these accounts may have full admin rights. A bash script is provided to automate the service account creation process. 

To control user access with policies using ABAC, you will need to create a policy file, which is also included in the above YAML. This policy should be provisioned on every master node, and the API servers should be configured with the appropriate flags to enforce the policy, granting the specified user read-only access to resources in the designated namespace.","suppose you have several clusters, and your users and components authenticate in a variety of ways.
for example: a running kubelet might authenticate using certificates.
a user might authenticate using tokens.
administrators might have sets of certificates that they provide to individual users.
with kubeconfig files, you can organize your clusters, users, and namespaces.
you can also define contexts to quickly and easily switch between clusters and namespaces.
========================================","suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for test work.
in the development cluster, your frontend developers work in a namespace called frontend, and your storage developers work in a namespace called storage.
in your test cluster, developers work in the default namespace, or they create auxiliary namespaces as they see fit.
access to the development cluster requires authentication by certificate.
access to the test cluster requires authentication by username and password.
create a directory named config-exercise.
in your config-exercise directory, create a file named config-demo with this content:

apiversion: v1
kind: config
preferences: {}

clusters:
- cluster:
  name: development
- cluster:
  name: test

users:
- name: developer
- name: experimenter

contexts:
- context:
  name: dev-frontend
- context:
  name: dev-storage
- context:
  name: exp-test

a configuration file describes clusters, users, and contexts.
your config-demo file has the framework to describe two clusters, two users, and three contexts.
go to your config-exercise directory.
enter these commands to add cluster details to your configuration file:

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster development --server=https://1.2.3.4 --certificate-authority=fake-ca-file
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster test --server=https://5.6.7.8 --insecure-skip-tls-verify

add user details to your configuration file: caution: storing passwords in kubernetes client config is risky.
a better alternative would be to use a credential plugin and store them separately.
see: client-go credential plugins 

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials developer --client-certificate=fake-cert-file --client-key=fake-key-seefile
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials experimenter --username=exp --password=some-password

note: to delete a user you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset users.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a cluster, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset clusters.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a context, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset contexts.&lt;name&gt;

add context details to your configuration file:

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-frontend --cluster=development --namespace=frontend --user=developer
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-storage --cluster=development --namespace=storage --user=developer
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context exp-test --cluster=test --namespace=default --user=experimenter

========================================","suppose you have several clusters, and your users and components authenticate in a variety of ways.
for example: a running kubelet might authenticate using certificates.
a user might authenticate using tokens.
administrators might have sets of certificates that they provide to individual users.
with kubeconfig files, you can organize your clusters, users, and namespaces.
you can also define contexts to quickly and easily switch between clusters and namespaces.
======================================== suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for test work.
in the development cluster, your frontend developers work in a namespace called frontend, and your storage developers work in a namespace called storage.
in your test cluster, developers work in the default namespace, or they create auxiliary namespaces as they see fit.
access to the development cluster requires authentication by certificate.
access to the test cluster requires authentication by username and password.

### Explanation
In Kubernetes 1.24, service account token secrets are no longer generated automatically. Refer to the ""urgent upgrade notes"" in the 1.24 changelog for more details. The `legacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate is in beta and is enabled by default. When this feature is active, secret API objects containing service account tokens will not be auto-generated for every service account. Instead, you can use the TokenRequest API to obtain service account tokens. If you require a non-expiring token, you can create a secret API object for the token controller to populate with a service account token by following the provided guide. 

This means that in Kubernetes 1.24, you will need to create the secret manually, and the token key in the data field will be set automatically for you. Since you are creating the secret manually, you will know its name and won't need to look it up in the service account object. This method should also work in earlier versions of Kubernetes.","a secret object stores sensitive data such as credentials used by pods to access services.
for example, you might need a secret to store the username and password needed to access a database.
you can create the secret by passing the raw data in the command, or by storing the credentials in files that you pass in the command.
the following commands create a secret that stores the username admin and the password s!b\*d$zdsb=.
use raw data run the following command:

kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
    --from-literal=username=admin \
    --from-literal=password='s!b\*d$zdsb='

you must use single quotes '' to escape special characters such as $, \, *, =, and ! in your strings.
if you don't, your shell will interpret these characters.
note: the stringdata field for a secret does not work well with server-side apply.
use source files store the credentials in files:

echo -n 'admin' &gt; ./username.txt
echo -n 's!b\*d$zdsb=' &gt; ./password.txt

the -n flag ensures that the generated files do not have an extra newline character at the end of the text.
this is important because when kubectl reads a file and encodes the content into a base64 string, the extra newline character gets encoded too.
you do not need to escape special characters in strings that you include in a file.
pass the file paths in the kubectl command:

kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
    --from-file=./username.txt \
    --from-file=./password.txt

the default key name is the file name.
you can optionally set the key name using --from-file=[key=]source.
for example:

kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
    --from-file=username=./username.txt \
    --from-file=password=./password.txt

with either method, the output is similar to: secret/db-user-pass created verify the secret check that the secret was created:

kubectl get secrets

the output is similar to:

name              type       data      age
db-user-pass      opaque     2         51s

view the details of the secret:

kubectl describe secret db-user-pass

the output is similar to:

name:            db-user-pass
namespace:       default
labels:          &lt;none&gt;

type:            opaque

data
====
password:    12 bytes
username:    5 bytes

the commands kubectl get and kubectl describe avoid showing the contents of a secret by default.
this is to protect the secret from being exposed accidentally, or from being stored in a terminal log.
decode the secret view the contents of the secret you created:

kubectl get secret db-user-pass -o jsonpath='{.data}'

the output is similar to:

{ ""password"": ""uyfcxcpkjhpec2i9"", ""username"": ""ywrtaw4="" }

decode the password data:

echo 'uyfcxcpkjhpec2i9' | base64 --decode

the output is similar to: s!b\*d$zdsb= caution: this is an example for documentation purposes.
in practice, this method could cause the command with the encoded data to be stored in your shell history.
anyone with access to your computer could find the command and decode the secret.
a better approach is to combine the view and decode commands.

kubectl get secret db-user-pass -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode

### Explanation
I utilized `envsubst` (as detailed in the [GNU documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/envsubst-invocation.html)) to achieve this. First, create a `deployment.yaml` file with the above content. 

After that, you can set the environment variable and apply the configuration using the following commands:

```bash
export name=my-test-nginx
envsubst < deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

I'm not certain which operating system you are using for this process. If you're on macOS, you can install `envsubst` with:

```bash
brew install gettext
brew link --force gettext
```","the api server sets certain fields to default values in the live configuration if they are not specified when the object is created.
here's a configuration file for a deployment.
the file does not specify strategy: application/simple_deployment.yaml 

apiversion: apps/v1

create the object using kubectl apply:

print the live configuration using kubectl get:

kubectl get -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/simple_deployment.yaml -o yaml

the output shows that the api server set several fields to default values in the live configuration.
these fields were not specified in the configuration file.

in a patch request, defaulted fields are not re-defaulted unless they are explicitly cleared as part of a patch request.
this can cause unexpected behavior for fields that are defaulted based on the values of other fields.
when the other fields are later changed, the values defaulted from them will not be updated unless they are explicitly cleared.
for this reason, it is recommended that certain fields defaulted by the server are explicitly defined in the configuration file, even if the desired values match the server defaults.
this makes it easier to recognize conflicting values that will not be re-defaulted by the server.

explanation: the user creates a deployment without defining

strategy.type

.
t","define and use labels  that identify semantic attributes of your application or deployment, such as

{ app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp, tier: frontend, phase: test, deployment: v3 }

.
you can use these labels to select the appropriate pods for other resources; for example, a service that selects all tier: frontend pods, or all phase: test components of

app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp

.
see the guestbook  app for examples of this approach.
a service can be made to span multiple deployments by omitting release-specific labels from its selector.
when you need to update a running service without downtime, use a deployment .
a desired state of an object is described by a deployment, and if changes to that spec are applied , the deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.
use the kubernetes common labels  for common use cases.
these standardized labels enrich the metadata in a way that allows tools, including kubectl and dashboard , to work in an interoperable way.
you can manipulate labels for debugging.
because kubernetes controllers (such as replicaset) and services match to pods using selector labels, removing the relevant labels from a pod will stop it from being considered by a controller or from being served traffic by a service.
if you remove the labels of an existing pod, its controller will create a new pod to take its place.
this is a useful way to debug a previously ""live"" pod in a ""quarantine"" environment.
to interactively remove or add labels, use kubectl label .
========================================","the following is an example of a deployment.
it creates a replicaset to bring up three nginx pods: controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml 

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerport: 80

in this example: a deployment named nginx-deployment is created, indicated by the

.metadata.name

field.
this name will become the basis for the replicasets and pods which are created later.
see writing a deployment spec  for more details.
the deployment creates a replicaset that creates three replicated pods, indicated by the

.spec.replicas

field.
the

.spec.selector

field defines how the created replicaset finds which pods to manage.
in this case, you select a label that is defined in the pod template (app: nginx).
however, more sophisticated selection rules are possible, as long as the pod template itself satisfies the rule.
note: the

.spec.selector.matchlabels

field is a map of {key,value} pairs.
a single {key,value} in the matchlabels map is equivalent to an element of matchexpressions, whose key field is ""key"", the operator is ""in"", and the values array contains only ""value"".
all of the requirements, from both matchlabels and matchexpressions, must be satisfied in order to match.
the

.spec.template

field contains the following sub-fields: the pods are labeled app: nginxusing the

.metadata.labels

field.
the pod template's specification, or

.spec

field, indicates that the pods run one container, nginx, which runs the nginx docker hub  image at version 1.14.2.
create one container and name it nginx using the

.spec.containers[0].name

field.
before you begin, make sure your kubernetes cluster is up and running.
follow the steps given below to create the above deployment: create the deployment by running the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml

run

kubectl get deployments

to check if the deployment was created.
if the deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:

name               ready   up-to-date   available   age
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s

when you inspect the deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed: name lists the names of the deployments in the namespace.
ready displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
it follows the pattern ready/desired.
up-to-date displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
available displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
age displays the amount of time that the application has been running.
notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to

.spec.replicas

field.
to see the deployment rollout status, run

kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

.
the output is similar to:

waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
deployment ""nginx-deployment"" successfully rolled out

run the

kubectl get deployments

again a few seconds later.
the output is similar to this:

name               ready   up-to-date   available   age
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           18s

notice that the deployment has created all three replicas, and all replicas are up-to-date (they contain the latest pod template) and available.
to see the replicaset (rs) created by the deployment, run

kubectl get rs

.
the output is similar to this:

name                          desired   current   ready   age
nginx-deployment-75675f5897   3         3         3       18s

replicaset output shows the following fields: name lists the names of the replicasets in the namespace.
desired displays the desired number of ","the api server sets certain fields to default values in the live configuration if they are not specified when the object is created.

### Explanation
When you enter a loop block in Helm templates, you lose access to the global context if you use `..`. To access the global context, you can use `$.` instead. According to the Helm documentation, there is one variable that is always global: `$`. This variable always points to the root context, which can be particularly useful when looping through a range and needing to reference the chart's release name. In your example, using this approach allows you to correctly reference the release name while iterating through the nodes.","many programming languages have support for looping using  for  loops,  foreach 
loops, or similar functional mechanisms. in helm's template language, the way to
iterate through a collection is to use the  range  operator.to start, let's add a list of pizza toppings to our  values.yaml  file:favorite : 
    drink :   coffee 
    food :   pizza 
 pizzatoppings : 
    - mushrooms 
    - cheese 
    - peppers 
    - onions 
    - pineapplenow we have a list (called a  slice  in templates) of  pizzatoppings . we can
modify our template to print this list into our configmap:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
    toppings :   |- 
     {{- range .values.pizzatoppings }}
     - {{ . | title | quote }}
     {{- end }}we can use  $  for accessing the list  values.pizzatoppings  from the parent
scope.  $  is mapped to the root scope when template execution begins and it
does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    toppings :   |- 
     {{- range $.values.pizzatoppings }}
     - {{ . | title | quote }}
     {{- end }}     
    {{- end }}let's take a closer look at the  toppings:  list. the  range  function will
""range over"" (iterate through) the  pizzatoppings  list. but now something
interesting happens. just like  with  sets the scope of  . , so does a  range 
operator. each time through the loop,  .  is set to the current pizza topping.
that is, the first time,  .  is set to  mushrooms . the second iteration it is
set to  cheese , and so on.we can send the value of  .  directly down a pipeline, so when we do  {{ . | title | quote }} , it sends  .  to  title  (title case function) and then to
 quote . if we run this template, the output will be:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml 
 apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   edgy-dragonfly-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    drink :   ""coffee"" 
    food :   ""pizza"" 
    toppings :   |- 
     - ""mushrooms""
     - ""cheese""
     - ""peppers""
     - ""onions""
     - ""pineapple""now, in this example we've done something tricky. the  toppings: |-  line is
declaring a multi-line string. so our list of toppings is actually not a yaml
list. it's a big string. why would we do this? because the data in configmaps
 data  is composed of key/value pairs, where both the key and the value are
simple strings. to understand why this is the case, take a look at the
 kubernetes configmap docs .
for us, though, this detail doesn't matter much.the  |-  marker in yaml takes a multi-line string. this can be a useful
technique for embedding big blocks of data inside of your manifests, as
exemplified here.sometimes it's useful to be able to quickly make a list inside of your template,
and then iterate over that list. helm templates have a function to make this
easy:  tuple . in computer science, a tuple is a list-like collection of fixed
size, but with arbitrary data types. this roughly conveys the way a  tuple  is
used.sizes :   |- 
     {{- range tuple ""small"" ""medium"" ""large"" }}
     - {{ . }}
     {{- end }}the above will produce this:sizes :   |- 
     - small
     - medium
     - largein addition to lists and tuples,  range  can be used to iterate over collections
that have a key and a value (like a  map  or  dict ). we'll see how to do that
in the next section when we introduce template variables.prev ← template function list next variables →","the next control structure to look at is the  with  action. this controls
variable scoping. recall that  .  is a reference to  the current scope . so
 .values  tells the template to find the  values  object in the current scope.the syntax for  with  is similar to a simple  if  statement:{{ with pipeline }}
   # restricted scope
 {{ end }}scopes can be changed.  with  can allow you to set the current scope ( . ) to a
particular object. for example, we've been working with  .values.favorite .
let's rewrite our configmap to alter the  .  scope to point to
 .values.favorite :apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }}note that we removed the  if  conditional from the previous exercise
because it is now unnecessary - the block after  with  only executes
if the value of  pipeline  is not empty.notice that now we can reference  .drink  and  .food  without qualifying them.
that is because the  with  statement sets  .  to point to  .values.favorite .
the  .  is reset to its previous scope after  {{ end }} .but here's a note of caution! inside of the restricted scope, you will not be
able to access the other objects from the parent scope using  . . this, for
example, will fail:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }} 
    {{- end }}it will produce an error because  release.name  is not inside of the restricted
scope for  . . however, if we swap the last two lines, all will work as expected
because the scope is reset after  {{ end }} .{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }}or, we can use  $  for accessing the object  release.name  from the parent
scope.  $  is mapped to the root scope when template execution begins and it
does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   $.release.name }} 
    {{- end }}after looking at  range , we will take a look at template variables, which offer
one solution to the scoping issue above.","say we've defined a simple template that looks like this:{{- define ""mychart.app"" -}} 
 app_name :   {{   .chart.name }} 
 app_version :   ""{{ .chart.version }}""

 {{   template ""mychart.app"" . }}if we render this, we will get an error like this:$  helm install --dry-run measly-whippet ./mychart

of a  template  call to other functions; the data is simply inserted inline.to work around this case, helm provides an alternative to  template  that will

### Explanation:
- The `name`, `labels`, and `image` fields should be customized to match your specific application.
- The `IP_ADDRESS` environment variable is set to the pod's IP address using `valueFrom` with `fieldRef`, which is a common practice in Kubernetes to dynamically reference the pod's own IP.
- Ensure that the `selector` matches the labels defined in the pod template to maintain proper association between the StatefulSet and its pods.","3598.0, 3597.0, 3602.0"

### Explanation
Instead of creating the `Ingress` resource named `app-ingress` in the `ingress-nginx` namespace, you should create it in the same namespace where your service `api-sand` and the corresponding pod are located. Alternatively, you can achieve cross-namespace ingress by using the `ExternalName` service type. This allows you to reference a service in a different namespace. The example provided demonstrates how to set up an `ExternalName` service and an `Ingress` resource that routes traffic to it.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

you can also do this with an ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.

      name: test
      port:

if you create it using

kubectl apply -f

you should be able to view the state of the ingress you added:

kubectl get ingress test-ingress



name           class         hosts   address         ports   age
test-ingress   external-lb   *       203.0.113.123   80      59s

where

203.0.113.123

is the ip allocated by the ingress controller to satisfy this ingress.
note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.
an ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.
for example, a setup like:  figure.
ingress fan out it would require an ingress such as: service/networking/simple-fanout-example.yaml

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.
 figure.
ingress name based virtual hosting the following ingress tells the backing load balancer to route requests based on the host header .

            port:
              number: 80

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

second.bar.com

to service2, and any traffic whose re","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code. a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.

### Explanation:
The issue arises because the Ingress resource is trying to reference a service (`api-sand`) that is located in a different namespace than the Ingress itself. In Kubernetes, Ingress resources can only route traffic to services within the same namespace unless you use a specific configuration to allow cross-namespace access. 

To fix this, ensure that the service `api-sand` is in the same namespace as the Ingress (`ingress-nginx`) or modify the Ingress to reference the correct service in its namespace. The corrected YAML above assumes the service is in the same namespace. If it is in a different namespace, you would need to create a service in the `ingress-nginx` namespace that proxies to the `api-sand` service in its original namespace.","```yaml

### Explanation:
The issue arises because the Ingress resource is trying to reference a service (`api-sand`) that is located in a different namespace than the Ingress itself. In Kubernetes, Ingress resources can only route traffic to services within the same namespace unless specific configurations are applied to allow cross-namespace access.

To resolve this, ensure that the service `api-sand` is in the same namespace as the Ingress (`ingress-nginx`). If the service is in a different namespace, you will need to either move the service to the `ingress-nginx` namespace or create a new service in the `ingress-nginx` namespace that proxies requests to the `api-sand` service in its original namespace. 

This adjustment will ensure that the Ingress can correctly route traffic to the intended backend service.","3397.0, 341.0, 344.0"

    The question is about ""ConfigMap creation in Helm"".

    <summary>
    The user is attempting to create a ConfigMap from a file (`config.json`) as part of a Helm deployment. They initially created the ConfigMap using `kubectl`, but now want to define it in a `configmap.yaml` file within their Helm chart. However, their current approach does not seem to work, and they are seeking guidance on how to properly structure the `configmap.yaml` to achieve the same result.

    }
```

### Explanation
Your `config.json` file should be located within the `mychart/` directory, not inside `mychart/templates`. The `configmap.yaml` file defines a ConfigMap that includes the contents of `config.json`. The Helm command `helm install --dry-run --debug mychart` simulates the installation of the chart, allowing you to see the rendered output. 

If you want the values in the `config.json` file to be sourced from `values.yaml`, you can modify the `configmap.yaml` as shown above. In this configuration, the keys and values from the `values.yaml` file will be dynamically inserted into the `config.json` structure. For example, if your `values.yaml` contains:
```yaml
json:
  key1: val1
  key2: val2
  key3: val3
```
The resulting ConfigMap will include these values in the `config.json` file when rendered.","say we've defined a simple template that looks like this:{{- define ""mychart.app"" -}}

### Explanation
It appears that your JSON override is incorrectly specified. Unfortunately, the `kubectl run` command will simply ignore any fields it does not recognize. To troubleshoot this issue, I executed the command you provided and then, in a separate terminal, ran:

```bash
kubectl get job ubuntu -o json
```

This allowed me to observe that the actual job structure differs from your JSON override. Specifically, you were missing the nested `template/spec`, and the `volumes`, `volumeMounts`, and `containers` fields need to be defined as arrays.","in this exercise, you create a pod that runs one container.
this pod has a volume of type emptydir  that lasts for the life of the pod, even if the container terminates and restarts.
here is the configuration file for the pod: pods/storage/redis.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: redis-storage
      mountpath: /data/redis
  volumes:
  - name: redis-storage
    emptydir: {}

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/redis.yaml

verify that the pod's container is running, and then watch for changes to the pod:

kubectl get pod redis --watch

the output looks like this:

name      ready     status    restarts   age
redis     1/1       running   0          13s

in another terminal, get a shell to the running container:

kubectl exec -it redis -- /bin/bash

in your shell, go to /data/redis, and then create a file:

root@redis:/data# cd /data/redis/
root@redis:/data/redis# echo hello &gt; test-file

in your shell, list the running processes:

root@redis:/data/redis# apt-get update
root@redis:/data/redis# apt-get install procps
root@redis:/data/redis# ps aux

the output is similar to this:

user       pid %cpu %mem    vsz   rss tty      stat start   time command
redis        1  0.1  0.1  33308  3828 ?        ssl  00:46   0:00 redis-server *:6379
root        12  0.0  0.0  20228  3020 ?        ss   00:47   0:00 /bin/bash
root        15  0.0  0.0  17500  2072 ?        r+   00:48   0:00 ps aux

in your shell, kill the redis process:

root@redis:/data/redis# kill &lt;pid&gt;

where <pid> is the redis process id (pid).
in your original terminal, watch for changes to the redis pod.
eventually, you will see something like this:

name      ready     status     restarts   age
redis     1/1       running    0          13s
redis     0/1       completed  0         6m
redis     1/1       running    1         6m

at this point, the container has terminated and restarted.
this is because the redis pod has a restartpolicy  of always.
get a shell into the restarted container:

kubectl exec -it redis -- /bin/bash

in your shell, go to /data/redis, and verify that test-file is still there.

root@redis:/data/redis# cd /data/redis/
root@redis:/data/redis# ls
test-file

delete the pod that you created for this exercise:

kubectl delete pod redis

========================================","when you create a pod, you can define a command and arguments for the containers that run in the pod.
to define a command, include the command field in the configuration file.
to define arguments for the command, include the args field in the configuration file.
the command and arguments that you define cannot be changed after the pod is created.
the command and arguments that you define in the configuration file override the default command and arguments provided by the container image.
if you define args, but do not define a command, the default command is used with your new arguments.
note: the command field corresponds to entrypoint, and the args field corresponds to cmd in some container runtimes.
in this exercise, you create a pod that runs one container.

create a pod based on the yaml configuration file:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/commands.yaml

list the running pods:

kubectl get pods

the output shows that the container that ran in the command-demo pod has completed.
to see the output of the command that ran in the container, view the logs from the pod:

kubectl logs command-demo

the output shows the values of the hostname and kubernetes_port environment variables:

command-demo

attach to the container:

kubectl attach -it image-volume bash

check the content of a file in the volume: cat /volume/dir/file the output is similar to: 1 you can also check another file in a different path: cat /volume/file the output is similar to: 2 ========================================","in this exercise, you create a pod that runs one container.

### Explanation
If your GKE project is named `my-gke` and the project containing the services that your GKE containers need to access is `my-data`, one way to set this up is as follows:

1. Create a service account in the `my-data` project and assign it the necessary GCP roles/permissions (for example, `roles/bigquery.dataviewer` if your GKE containers need to read from BigQuery tables).

2. Generate a service account key for that service account. When you do this in the Google Cloud Console, following the instructions at https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys, a JSON file containing the service account credentials will be automatically downloaded.

3. Create a Kubernetes Secret resource to store those service account credentials. The YAML snippet above illustrates how this might look.

4. Mount the credentials in the container that requires access. You can specify the volume and volume mount in your pod specification.

5. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in the container to point to the path of the mounted credentials file.

With this setup, any official GCP clients (such as the GCP Python client, GCP Java client, or the gcloud CLI) will recognize the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and use the credentials of the service account you created when making API requests.","this example illustrates a pod which consumes a secret containing production credentials and another pod which consumes a secret with test environment credentials.
create a secret for prod environment credentials:

kubectl create secret generic prod-db-secret --from-literal=username=produser --from-literal=password=y4nys7f11

the output is similar to:

secret ""prod-db-secret"" created

create a secret for test environment credentials.

kubectl create secret generic test-db-secret --from-literal=username=testuser --from-literal=password=iluvtests

the output is similar to:

secret ""test-db-secret"" created

note: special characters such as $, \, *, =, and ! will be interpreted by your shell  and require escaping.
in most shells, the easiest way to escape the password is to surround it with single quotes (').
for example, if your actual password is s!b\*d$zdsb=, you should execute the command as follows:

kubectl create secret generic dev-db-secret --from-literal=username=devuser --from-literal=password='s!b\*d$zdsb='

you do not need to escape special characters in passwords from files (--from-file).

note: how the specs for the two pods differ only in one field; this facilitates creating pods with different capabilities from a common pod template.
apply all those objects on the api server by running:

kubectl create -f pod.yaml

both containers will have the following files present on their filesystems with the values for each container's environment: /etc/secret-volume/username /etc/secret-volume/password you could further simplify the base pod specification by using two service accounts: prod-user with the prod-db-secret test-user with the test-db-secret the pod specification is shortened to:

references secret  volume  pod  ========================================","you can use secrets for purposes such as the following: set environment variables for a container .
provide credentials such as ssh keys or passwords to pods .
allow the kubelet to pull container images from private registries .
the kubernetes control plane also uses secrets; for example, bootstrap token secrets  are a mechanism to help automate node registration.
use case: dotfiles in a secret volume you can make your data ""hidden"" by defining a key that begins with a dot.
this key represents a dotfile or ""hidden"" file.
for example, when the following secret is mounted into a volume, secret-volume, the volume will contain a single file, called

.secret-file

, and the dotfile-test-container will have this file present at the path

/etc/secret-volume/.secret-file

.
note: files beginning with dot characters are hidden from the output of ls -l; you must use ls -la to see them when listing directory contents.

use case: secret visible to one container in a pod consider a program that needs to handle http requests, do some complex business logic, and then sign some messages with an hmac.
because it has complex application logic, there might be an unnoticed remote file reading exploit in the server, which could expose the private key to an attacker.
this could be divided into two processes in two containers: a frontend container which handles user interaction and business logic, but which cannot see the private key; and a signer container that can see the private key, and responds to simple signing requests from the frontend (for example, over localhost networking).
with this partitioned approach, an attacker now has to trick the application server into doing something rather arbitrary, which may be harder than getting it to read a file.
alternatives to secrets rather than using a secret to protect confidential data, you can pick from alternatives.
here are some of your options: if your cloud-native component needs to authenticate to another application that you know is running within the same kubernetes cluster, you can use a serviceaccount  and its tokens to identify your client.
there are third-party tools that you can run, either within or outside your cluster, that manage sensitive data.
for example, a service that pods access over https, that reveals a secret if the client correctly authenticates (for example, with a serviceaccount token).
for authentication, you can implement a custom signer for x.509 certificates, and use certificatesigningrequests  to let that custom signer issue certificates to pods that need them.
you can use a device plugin  to expose node-local encryption hardware to a specific pod.
for example, you can schedule trusted pods onto nodes that provide a trusted platform module, configured out-of-band.
you can also combine two or more of those options, including the option to use secret objects themselves.
for example: implement (or deploy) an operator  that fetches short-lived session tokens from an external service, and then creates secrets based on those short-lived session tokens.
pods running in your cluster can make use of the session tokens, and operator ensures they are valid.
this separation means that you can run pods that are unaware of the exact mechanisms for issuing and refreshing those session tokens.
========================================","in this exercise, you create username and password secrets  from local files.
you then create a pod that runs one container, using a projected  volume to mount the secrets into the same shared directory.

# package these files into secrets:

kubectl create secret generic pass --from-file=./password.txt

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/projected.yaml

verify that the pod's container is running, and then watch for changes to the pod:

kubectl get --watch pod test-projected-volume

the output looks like this:

test-projected-volume   1/1       running   0          14s

in another terminal, get a shell to the running container:

kubectl exec -it test-projected-volume -- /bin/sh

in your shell, verify that the projected-volume directory contains your projected sources: ls /projected-volume/ ========================================","this example illustrates a pod which consumes a secret containing production credentials and another pod which consumes a secret with test environment credentials.

executes.this is caused by macos's mdns library. it attempts to load that file to read
debugging settings (if enabled). the file handle probably should not be held open, and
this issue has been reported to apple. however, it is macos, not helm, that causes this
behavior.if you do not want helm to load this file, you may be able to compile helm to as
a static library that does not use the host network stack. doing so will inflate the

### Explanation
For Kubernetes version 1.19.x, you should specify `batch/v1beta1` as the `apiVersion` for your CronJob. This is outlined in the documentation for version 1.19, which can be found at: https://v1-19.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/. The CronJob resource only reached stable status in Kubernetes version 1.21.","cronjob represents the configuration of a single cron job.

run the example cronjob by using this command:

kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/job/cronjob.yaml

the output is similar to this:

cronjob.batch/hello created

after creating the cron job, get its status using this command:

kubectl get cronjob hello

the output is similar to this:

name    schedule      suspend   active   last schedule   age
hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        &lt;none&gt;          10s

as you can see from the results of the command, the cron job has not scheduled or run any jobs yet.
watch  for the job to be created in around one minute:

kubectl get jobs --watch

the output is similar to this:

now you've seen one running job scheduled by the ""hello"" cron job.
you can stop watching the job and view the cron job again to see that it scheduled the job:

kubectl get cronjob hello

you should see that the cron job hello successfully scheduled a job at the time specified in last schedule.
there are currently 0 active jobs, meaning that the job has completed or failed.
now, find the pods that the last scheduled job created and view the standard output of one of the pods.

The previous response contained incorrect casing for the `jobTemplate` and `restartPolicy` fields. These field names must be capitalized to comply with Kubernetes API specifications.

### Explanation
In the latest Kubernetes release, you can utilize a feature called initContainers to manage the order of container initialization, which replaces the need for the postStart lifecycle hook mentioned in my previous response. The initContainer will ensure that the necessary files are copied before the main application container starts. 

Please note that initContainers are still considered a beta feature, and you can refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more details on handling initialization: [Kubernetes Init Containers](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/production-pods/#handling-initialization).","in this part of exercise, you create a pod that has one container, and you project pod-level fields into the running container as files.
here is the manifest for the pod: pods/inject/dapi-volume.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod

      - while true; do
          if [[ -e /etc/podinfo/labels ]]; then
            echo -en '\n\n'; cat /etc/podinfo/labels; fi;
          if [[ -e /etc/podinfo/annotations ]]; then
            echo -en '\n\n'; cat /etc/podinfo/annotations; fi;
          sleep 5;
        done;
      volumemounts:
        - name: podinfo
          mountpath: /etc/podinfo
  volumes:
    - name: podinfo
      downwardapi:
        items:
          - path: ""labels""
            fieldref:
              fieldpath: metadata.labels
          - path: ""annotations""
            fieldref:
              fieldpath: metadata.annotations

in the manifest, you can see that the pod has a downwardapi volume, and the container mounts the volume at /etc/podinfo.
look at the items array under downwardapi.
each element of the array defines a downwardapi volume.
the first element specifies that the value of the pod's

metadata.labels

field should be stored in a file named labels.
the second element specifies that the value of the pod's annotations field should be stored in a file named annotations.
note: the fields in this example are pod fields.
they are not fields of the container in the pod.
create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/dapi-volume.yaml

verify that the container in the pod is running:

kubectl get pods

view the container's logs:

kubectl logs kubernetes-downwardapi-volume-example

the output shows the contents of the labels file and the annotations file:

cluster=""test-cluster1""
rack=""rack-22""
zone=""us-est-coast""

build=""two""
builder=""john-doe""

get a shell into the container that is running in your pod:

kubectl exec -it kubernetes-downwardapi-volume-example -- sh

in your shell, view the labels file:

/# cat /etc/podinfo/labels

the output shows that all of the pod's labels have been written to the labels file:

cluster=""test-cluster1""
rack=""rack-22""
zone=""us-est-coast""

similarly, view the annotations file:

/# cat /etc/podinfo/annotations

view the files in the /etc/podinfo directory:

/# ls -lar /etc/podinfo

in the output, you can see that the labels and annotations files are in a temporary subdirectory: in this example,

..2982_06_02_21_47_53.299460680

.
in the /etc/podinfo directory,

..data

is a symbolic link to the temporary subdirectory.
also in the /etc/podinfo directory, labels and annotations are symbolic links.

using symbolic links enables dynamic atomic refresh of the metadata; updates are written to a new temporary directory, and the

..data

symlink is updated atomically using rename(2) .
note: a container using downward api as a subpath  volume mount will not receive downward api updates.

the first container listed in the configuration file runs an nginx server.
the mount path for the shared volume is /usr/share/nginx/html.
the second container is based on the debian image, and has a mount path of /pod-data.

### Explanation
I have reviewed your issue and reached the following conclusions: The ingress will function correctly, and the warnings you are encountering are merely notifications regarding the available API versioning. There is no need for concern about this. I have observed similar warnings:

```
@microk8s:~$ kubectl describe ing
warning: extensions/v1beta1 ingress is deprecated in v1.14+, unavailable in v1.22+; use networking.k8s.io/v1 ingress
```

Regarding the reason for these warnings appearing even when you specify `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1`, here’s the explanation: This behavior is expected. When you create an ingress object, it can be accessed through any version, as the server manages the conversion to the requested version. The command `kubectl get ingress` is ambiguous because it does not specify which version you want to retrieve. In such cases, `kubectl` consults the discovery documents provided by the server to find the first group/version that includes the specified resource.

Historically, for compatibility reasons, `extensions/v1beta1` has been favored over other API versions. Now that ingress is the only resource left in that group, and since it has a GA replacement, version 1.20 will lower its priority so that `kubectl get ingress` will read from `networking.k8s.io/v1`. However, a server running version 1.19 will still adhere to the historical priority.

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

### Explanation
I appreciate Peter for pointing out that the idea was fundamentally sound, which led me to discover the missing link. Since a ServiceMonitor is designed to monitor services, I overlooked the necessity of creating a service, which is not included in the GitLab Helm chart. Ultimately, this YAML configuration resolved the issue for me, and the metrics are now visible in Prometheus. 

It's worth noting that the target port for metrics is specified in the GitLab Runner chart.","to deploy a prometheus scraper to consistently scrape the metrics, use the following configuration:

then you can view the prometheus dashboard by proxying the port of the prometheus scraper to your local port.
kubectl port-forward pods/prom-pod 9090:9090
for your amazon eks cluster, the core kubernetes control plane metrics are also ingested into amazon cloudwatch metrics under the aws/eks namespace.
to view them, open the cloudwatch console and select all metrics from the left navigation pane.

========================================","the first step in troubleshooting is triage.
what is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.
check the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:

kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}

look at the state of the containers in the pod.
are they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.
my pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.
generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.
look at the output of the

kubectl describe ...

command above.
there should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.
reasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
see compute resources document  for more information.
you are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.
in most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.
if you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.
my pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.
again, the information from

kubectl describe ...

should be informative.
the most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.
there are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
have you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.
for example, if you use docker on your pc, run

docker pull &lt;image&gt;

.
my pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.
this typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.
to identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.
if the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.
disable the webhook for update operations.
report an issue with the corresponding provider.
if you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.
for example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.
for a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.
in other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.
this allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.
my pod is crashing or otherwise unhealthy once your pod has been scheduled, the methods described in debug running pods  are available for debugging.
my pod is running but not doing what i told it to do if your pod is not behaving as you expected, it may be that there was an error in your pod description (e.g.

mypod.yaml

file on your local machine), and that the error was silently ignored when you created the pod.
often a section of the pod description is nested incorrectly, or a key name is typed incorrectly, and so the key is ignored.
for example, if you misspelled command as commnd then the pod will be created but will not use the command line you intended it to use.
the first thing to do is to delete your pod and try creating it again with the --validate option.
for example, run

kubectl apply --va","a service is an object  (the same way that a pod or a configmap is an object).
you can create, view or modify service definitions using the kubernetes api.
usually you use a tool such as kubectl to make those api calls for you.
for example, suppose you have a set of pods that each listen on tcp port 9376 and are labelled as

app.kubernetes.io/name=myapp

.
you can define a service to publish that tcp listener: service/simple-service.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: tcp
      port: 80
      targetport: 9376

applying this manifest creates a new service named ""my-service"" with the default clusterip service type .
the service targets tcp port 9376 on any pod with the

app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp

label.
kubernetes assigns this service an ip address (the cluster ip ), that is used by the virtual ip address mechanism.
for more details on that mechanism, read virtual ips and service proxies .
the controller for that service continuously scans for pods that match its selector, and then makes any necessary updates to the set of endpointslices for the service.
the name of a service object must be a valid rfc 1035 label name .
note: a service can map any incoming port to a targetport.
by default and for convenience, the targetport is set to the same value as the port field.
port definitions port definitions in pods have names, and you can reference these names in the targetport attribute of a service.
for example, we can bind the targetport of the service to the pod port in the following way:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - containerport: 80
        name: http-web-svc

---
apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
  ports:
  - name: name-of-service-port
    protocol: tcp
    port: 80
    targetport: http-web-svc

this works even if there is a mixture of pods in the service using a single configured name, with the same network protocol available via different port numbers.
this offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving your services.
for example, you can change the port numbers that pods expose in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.
the default protocol for services is tcp ; you can also use any other supported protocol .
because many services need to expose more than one port, kubernetes supports multiple port definitions  for a single service.
each port definition can have the same protocol, or a different one.
services without selectors services most commonly abstract access to kubernetes pods thanks to the selector, but when used with a corresponding set of endpointslices  objects and without a selector, the service can abstract other kinds of backends, including ones that run outside the cluster.
for example: you want to have an external database cluster in production, but in your test environment you use your own databases.
you want to point your service to a service in a different namespace  or on another cluster.
you are migrating a workload to kubernetes.
while evaluating the approach, you run only a portion of your backends in kubernetes.
in any of these scenarios you can define a service without specifying a selector to match pods.
for example:

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: tcp
      port: 80
      targetport: 9376

because this service has no selector, the corresponding endpointslice (and legacy endpoints) objects are not created automatically.
you can map the service to the network address and port where it's running, by adding an endpointslice object manually.
for example:

apiversion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: endpointslice
metadata:
  name: my-service-1 # by convention, use the name ","to deploy a prometheus scraper to consistently scrape the metrics, use the following configuration:

======================================== the first step in troubleshooting is triage.
what is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.
check the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:

kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}

look at the state of the containers in the pod.
are they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.
my pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.
generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.
look at the output of the

kubectl describe ...

command above.
there should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.
reasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
see compute resources document  for more information.
you are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.
in most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.
if you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.
my pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.
again, the information from

kubectl describe ...

should be informative.
the most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.
there are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
have you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.
for example, if you use docker on your pc, run

docker pull &lt;image&gt;

.
my pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.
this typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.
to identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.
if the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.
disable the webhook for update operations.
report an issue with the corresponding provider.
if you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.
for example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.
for a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.
in other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.
this allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.

### Explanation
To resolve the error `error: unable to recognize ""ingress.yaml"": no matches for kind ""ingress"" in version ""extensions/v1beta1""`, you need to update the `apiVersion` to `networking.k8s.io/v1`. The `networkpolicy` resource in the `extensions/v1beta1` API version is no longer supported, and you should migrate to the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API version, which has been available since v1.8. Existing persisted data can still be accessed and modified using the new version.

For the second issue, you need to make several adjustments to your Ingress definition to ensure the Kubernetes dashboard is properly exposed on the MicroK8s cluster:

1. Add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2`.
2. Include the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | rewrite ^(/dashboard)$ $1/ redirect;`.
3. Change the path from `path: /dashboard` to `path: /dashboard(/|$)(.*)`.

These changes are necessary to correctly forward requests to the backend pods. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation modifies the URL before it reaches the backend pods. In the path `/dashboard(/|$)(.*)`, the `(.*)` captures the dynamic URL generated when accessing the Kubernetes dashboard. The rewrite target annotation replaces this captured data in the URL before sending the request to the `kubernetes-dashboard` service. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` annotation ensures that a trailing slash (`/`) is added only when accessing `alb-url/dashboard`.

Additionally, you need to make two more changes:

1. Add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""https""` to instruct the NGINX Ingress to communicate with the dashboard service over HTTPS.
2. Include the annotation `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: public` to specify the use of the NGINX Ingress created by the MicroK8s Ingress plugin.

After implementing all the above changes, the final YAML configuration should work correctly without needing to run the MicroK8s proxy command.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

### Explanation
I would like to point out that, according to the Kubernetes deprecation guide, the `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API version of Ingress is no longer supported as of v1.22. The changes include:

- The `backend` `servicename` field has been renamed to `service.name`.
- Numeric `backend` `serviceport` fields have been renamed to `service.port.number`.
- String `backend` `serviceport` fields have been renamed to `service.port.name`.
- The `pathType` is now required for each specified path, with options being `Prefix`, `Exact`, and `ImplementationSpecific`.

This means we need to make the following modifications to transition from the previous version:","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

### Explanation
It is common to implement basic authentication for securing access. According to Kubernetes documentation, you can protect access to Traefik by following these steps:

1. Create an authentication file using the `htpasswd` tool. You will be prompted to enter a password for the user:
   ```bash
   htpasswd -c ./auth
   ```

2. Use `kubectl` to create a secret in the `monitoring` namespace with the file generated by `htpasswd`:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic mysecret --from-file=auth --namespace=monitoring
   ```

3. Enable basic authentication by adding annotations to the Ingress object:
   - `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: ""basic""`
   - `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: ""mysecret""`

The complete configuration for basic authentication would look like the YAML provided above. You can apply this configuration using the following command:
```bash
kubectl create -f prometheus-ingress.yaml -n monitoring
```

This setup should work without any issues.","official document: it is possible to add authentication by adding additional annotations in the ingress rule. the source of the authentication is a secret that contains usernames and passwords.  the annotations are: ``` nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: [basic|digest] ```  indicates the [http authentication type: basic or digest access authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617).  ``` nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: secretname ```  the name of the secret that contains the usernames and passwords which are granted access to the `path`s defined in the ingress rules. this annotation also accepts the alternative form ""namespace/secretname"", in which case the secret lookup is performed in the referenced namespace instead of the ingress namespace.  ``` nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret-type: [auth-file|auth-map] ```  the `auth-secret` can have two forms:  - `auth-file` - default, an htpasswd file in the key `auth` within the secret - `auth-map` - the keys of the secret are the usernames, and the values are the hashed passwords  ``` nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-realm: ""realm string"" ```  !!! example     please check the [auth](../../examples/auth/basic/readme.md) example. medium website: welcome to part 4 of our series! in our previous installments, we delved into the intricacies of ingress in kubernetes, exploring its workings, setting up an nginx controller, and practical applications like routing with various ingress types. now, in this segment, well explore the vital concept of authentication. in todays digital landscape, ensuring the security of web applications is paramount in safeguarding them from potential threats. authentication serves as a cornerstone in this endeavor. so, lets dive into some fundamental authentication mechanisms. basic authentication this example demonstrates how to implement authentication within an ingress rule by leveraging a secret containing a file generated with htpasswd. lets start by implementing the basic authentication using ingress nginx controller. create htpasswd file generate a password file using the htpasswd command. for example htpasswd -c auth anvesh youll be prompted to enter a password for the user anvesh. convert htpasswd into a secret create a kubernetes secret from the generated htpasswd file kubectl create secret generic basic-auth --from-fileauth its crucial to note that the generated file must be named auth specifically, the secret must possess a key data.auth. failure to adhere to this naming convention may result in the ingress controller returning a 503 error. html headtitle503 service temporarily unavailabletitlehead body centerh1503 service temporarily unavailableh1center hrcenternginxcenter body html create an ingress tied to the basic-auth secret use kubectl to create an ingress resource, specifying the authentication settings in the annotations this ingress will require basic authentication for requests to anvesh.domain.com . here we are using blogging application to test connectivity. so we are connecting to blogging-svc in the backend. please check our previous blogs, to check how to setup blogging application. confirm authorization is required once the application, secret, and ingress are installed, then we can test the basic authentication using curl or by accessing the application page externally. now lets use curl to test the authentication requirement curl -v httpingress_ip_or_hostname -h host anvesh.domain.com this should return a 401 unauthorized response. curl -v http161.35.242.187 -h host anvesh.domain.com trying 161.35.240.18780... connected to 161.35.242.187 161.35.240.187 port 80 #0 get http1.1 host anvesh.domain.com user-agent curl7.88.1 accept http1.1 401 unauthorized date mon, 08 apr 2024 014358 gmt content-type texthtml content-length 172 connection keep-alive www-authenticate basic realmauthentication required -

### Explanation:
1. **Localization**: The issue was with the annotations and the API version used in the Ingress resource.
2. **Reasoning**: The annotations should use the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/` prefix instead of `ingress.kubernetes.io/`. Additionally, the `apiVersion` should be updated to `networking.k8s.io/v1` for compatibility with newer Kubernetes versions.
3. **Remediation**: The Ingress YAML has been corrected to use the proper annotations and API version.
4. **Validation**: The syntax and schema are now correct, ensuring that the basic authentication should work as intended.","```yaml

```

### Explanation:
1. **Factual Grounding**: The Ingress resource has been updated to use the correct annotations for basic authentication with NGINX Ingress Controller, which is consistent with the retrieved knowledge.
2. **Avoid Overgeneralization**: The response focuses specifically on the necessary corrections to the Ingress configuration without introducing unrelated recommendations.
3. **Context-Aligned Terminology**: The annotations and API version are aligned with the NGINX Ingress Controller specifications.
4. **Refactor Only What's Necessary**: The structure of the original response has been preserved while correcting the annotations and API version.
5. **Sufficient Context**: The provided context was sufficient to address the issue with the Ingress configuration. 

This corrected Ingress YAML should now function as intended, enabling basic authentication for the specified host and path.","3391.0, 3389.0, 3397.0"

### Explanation
You can use `generateName` instead of `name`, which appends a random suffix to the specified base name. This will modify your template accordingly. However, it's important to note that this approach will only work with the command `kubectl create -f template.yaml`. The `apply` command looks for a resource by its name and attempts to compare definitions, but since this template does not specify a concrete name, it won't function with `apply`.","here's the configuration file for a deployment that has two replicas.
each replica is a pod that has one container: application/deployment-patch.yaml 

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  name: patch-demo
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: patch-demo-ctr
        image: nginx
      tolerations:
      - effect: noschedule
        key: dedicated
        value: test-team

create the deployment:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment-patch.yaml

view the pods associated with your deployment:

kubectl get pods

the output shows that the deployment has two pods.
the 1/1 indicates that each pod has one container:

name                        ready     status    restarts   age
patch-demo-28633765-670qr   1/1       running   0          23s
patch-demo-28633765-j5qs3   1/1       running   0          23s

make a note of the names of the running pods.
later, you will see that these pods get terminated and replaced by new ones.
at this point, each pod has one container that runs the nginx image.
now suppose you want each pod to have two containers: one that runs nginx and one that runs redis.
create a file named

patch-file.yaml

that has this content:

spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: patch-demo-ctr-2
        image: redis

patch your deployment:

kubectl patch deployment patch-demo --patch-file patch-file.yaml

view the patched deployment:

kubectl get deployment patch-demo --output yaml

the output shows that the podspec in the deployment has two containers:

containers:
- image: redis
  imagepullpolicy: always
  name: patch-demo-ctr-2
  ...
- image: nginx
  imagepullpolicy: always
  name: patch-demo-ctr
  ...

view the pods associated with your patched deployment:

kubectl get pods

the output shows that the running pods have different names from the pods that were running previously.
the deployment terminated the old pods and created two new pods that comply with the updated deployment spec.
the 2/2 indicates that each pod has two containers:

name                          ready     status    restarts   age
patch-demo-1081991389-2wrn5   2/2       running   0          1m
patch-demo-1081991389-jmg7b   2/2       running   0          1m

take a closer look at one of the patch-demo pods:

kubectl get pod &lt;your-pod-name&gt; --output yaml

the output shows that the pod has two containers: one running nginx and one running redis:

containers:
- image: redis
  ...
- image: nginx
  ...

notes on the strategic merge patch the patch you did in the preceding exercise is called a strategic merge patch .
notice that the patch did not replace the containers list.
instead it added a new container to the list.
in other words, the list in the patch was merged with the existing list.
this is not always what happens when you use a strategic merge patch on a list.
in some cases, the list is replaced, not merged.
with a strategic merge patch, a list is either replaced or merged depending on its patch strategy.
the patch strategy is specified by the value of the patchstrategy key in a field tag in the kubernetes source code.
for example, the containers field of podspec struct has a patchstrategy of merge:

type podspec struct {
  ...
  containers []container `json:""containers"" patchstrategy:""merge"" patchmergekey:""name"" ...`
  ...
}

you can also see the patch strategy in the openapi spec :

""io.k8s.api.core.v1.podspec"": {
    ...,
    ""containers"": {
        ""description"": ""list of containers belonging to the pod.  ....""
    },
    ""x-kubernetes-patch-merge-key"": ""name"",
    ""x-kubernetes-patch-strategy"": ""merge""
}

and you can see the patch strategy in the kubernetes api documentation .

      - effect:","kustomize is a tool for customizing kubernetes configurations.
it has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.
the source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:
  - .env
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

this is because pods are designed as relatively ephemeral, disposable entities.
when a pod gets created (directly by you, or indirectly by a controller ), the new pod is scheduled to run on a node  in your cluster.
the pod remains on that node until the pod finishes execution, the pod object is deleted, the pod is evicted for lack of resources, or the node fails.
note: restarting a container in a pod should not be confused with restarting a pod.
a pod is not a process, but an environment for running container(s).
a pod persists until it is deleted.
the name of a pod must be a valid dns subdomain  value, but this can produce unexpected results for the pod hostname.
for best compatibility, the name should follow the more restrictive rules for a dns label .

these two are the only operating systems supported for now by kubernetes.
in the future, this list may be expanded.
in kubernetes v1.32, the value of

.spec.os.name

does not affect how the kube-scheduler  picks a node for the pod to run on.
in any cluster where there is more than one operating system for running nodes, you should set the kubernetes.io/os  label correctly on each node, and define pods with a nodeselector based on the operating system label.
the kube-scheduler assigns your pod to a node based on other criteria and may or may not succeed in picking a suitable node placement where the node os is right for the containers in that pod.
the pod security standards  also use this field to avoid enforcing policies that aren't relevant to the operating system.
pods and controllers you can use workload resources to create and manage multiple pods for you.
a controller for the resource handles replication and rollout and automatic healing in case of pod failure.
for example, if a node fails, a controller notices that pods on that node have stopped working and creates a replacement pod.
the scheduler places the replacement pod onto a healthy node.
here are some examples of workload resources that manage one or more pods: deployment  statefulset  daemonset  pod templates controllers for workload  resources create pods from a pod template and manage those pods on your behalf.
podtemplates are specifications for creating pods, and are included in workload resources such as deployments , jobs , and daemonsets .
each controller for a workload resource uses the podtemplate inside the workload object to make actual pods.
the podtemplate is part of the desired state of whatever workload resource you used to run your app.
when you create a pod, you can include environment variables  in the pod template for the containers that run in the pod.
the sample below is a manifest for a simple job with a template that starts one container.
the container in that pod prints a message then pauses.

apiversion: batch/v1
kind: job
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  template:
    # this is the pod template
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: busybox:1.28
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo ""hello, kubernetes!"" &amp;&amp; sleep 3600']
      restartpolicy: onfailure
    # the pod template ends here

modifying the pod template or switching to a new pod template has no direct effect on the pods that already exist.
if you change the pod template for a workload resource, that resource needs to create replacement pods that use the updated template.
for example, the statefulset controller ensures that the running pods match the current pod template for each statefulset object.
if you edit the statefulset to change its pod template, the statefulset starts to create new pods based on the updated template.
eventually, all of the old pods are replaced with new pods, and the update is complete.
each workload resource implements its own rules for handling changes to the pod t","here's the configuration file for a deployment that has two replicas.
each replica is a pod that has one container: application/deployment-patch.yaml 

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  name: patch-demo
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: nginx
  template:

        image: nginx
      tolerations:
      - effect: noschedule
        key: dedicated
        value: test-team

create the deployment:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment-patch.yaml

view the pods associated with your deployment:

kubectl get pods

the output shows that the deployment has two pods.
the 1/1 indicates that each pod has one container:

name                        ready     status    restarts   age
patch-demo-28633765-670qr   1/1       running   0          23s
patch-demo-28633765-j5qs3   1/1       running   0          23s

make a note of the names of the running pods.
later, you will see that these pods get terminated and replaced by new ones.
at this point, each pod has one container that runs the nginx image.
now suppose you want each pod to have two containers: one that runs nginx and one that runs redis.
create a file named

patch-file.yaml

that has this content:

spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: patch-demo-ctr-2

patch your deployment:

kubectl patch deployment patch-demo --patch-file patch-file.yaml

view the patched deployment:

kubectl get deployment patch-demo --output yaml

the output shows that the podspec in the deployment has two containers:

containers:
- image: redis
  imagepullpolicy: always
  name: patch-demo-ctr-2
  ...
- image: nginx
  imagepullpolicy: always
  name: patch-demo-ctr
  ...

view the pods associated with your patched deployment:

kubectl get pods

the output shows that the running pods have different names from the pods that were running previously.
the deployment terminated the old pods and created two new pods that comply with the updated deployment spec.
the 2/2 indicates that each pod has two containers:

name                          ready     status    restarts   age
patch-demo-1081991389-2wrn5   2/2       running   0          1m
patch-demo-1081991389-jmg7b   2/2       running   0          1m

take a closer look at one of the patch-demo pods:

kubectl get pod &lt;your-pod-name&gt; --output yaml

the output shows that the pod has two containers: one running nginx and one running redis:

containers:
- image: redis
  ...
- image: nginx
  ...

notes on the strategic merge patch the patch you did in the preceding exercise is called a strategic merge patch .
notice that the patch did not replace the containers list.
instead it added a new container to the list.
in other words, the list in the patch was merged with the existing list.
this is not always what happens when you use a strategic merge patch on a list.
in some cases, the list is replaced, not merged.
with a strategic merge patch, a list is either replaced or merged depending on its patch strategy.
the patch strategy is specified by the value of the patchstrategy key in a field tag in the kubernetes source code.
for example, the containers field of podspec struct has a patchstrategy of merge:

type podspec struct {
  ...
  containers []container `json:""containers"" patchstrategy:""merge"" patchmergekey:""name"" ...`
  ...
}

you can also see the patch strategy in the openapi spec :

""io.k8s.api.core.v1.podspec"": {
    ...,
    ""containers"": {
        ""description"": ""list of containers belonging to the pod.  ....""
    },
    ""x-kubernetes-patch-merge-key"": ""name"",
    ""x-kubernetes-patch-strategy"": ""merge""
}

and you can see the patch strategy in the kubernetes api documentation .

      - effect: kustomize is a tool for customizing kubernetes configurations.
it has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.
the source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:
  - .env
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;deployment.yaml

  name: e you'll rarely create individual pods directly in kubernetes—even singleton pods.
this is because pods are designed as relatively ephemeral, disposable entities.
when a pod gets created (directly by you, or indirectly by a controller ), the new pod is scheduled to run on a node  in your cluster.
the pod remains on that node until the pod finishes execution, the pod object is deleted, the pod is evicted for lack of resources, or the node fails.
note: restarting a container in a pod should not be confused with restarting a pod.
a pod is not a process, but an environment for running container(s).
a pod persists until it is deleted.
the name of a pod must be a valid dns subdomain  value, but this can produce unexpected results for the pod hostname.
for best compatibility, the name should follow the more restrictive rules for a dns label .

### Explanation
When utilizing a provisioner, you typically do not need to create the PersistentVolume (PV) manually. Instead, you can simply create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that specifies the desired storage class, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) will automatically provision the PV for you with the requested storage size and type.","users request dynamically provisioned storage by including a storage class in their persistentvolumeclaim.
before kubernetes v1.6, this was done via the

volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class

annotation.
however, this annotation is deprecated since v1.9.
users now can and should instead use the storageclassname field of the persistentvolumeclaim object.
the value of this field must match the name of a storageclass configured by the administrator (see below ).
to select the ""fast"" storage class, for example, a user would create the following persistentvolumeclaim:

apiversion: v1
kind: persistentvolumeclaim
metadata:
  name: claim1
spec:
  accessmodes:
    - readwriteonce
  storageclassname: fast
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 30gi

this claim results in an ssd-like persistent disk being automatically provisioned.
when the claim is deleted, the volume is destroyed.
========================================","each storageclass contains the fields provisioner, parameters, and reclaimpolicy, which are used when a persistentvolume belonging to the class needs to be dynamically provisioned to satisfy a persistentvolumeclaim (pvc).
the name of a storageclass object is significant, and is how users can request a particular class.
administrators set the name and other parameters of a class when first creating storageclass objects.
as an administrator, you can specify a default storageclass that applies to any pvcs that don't request a specific class.

### Explanation
Typically, DNS names are assigned to services rather than pods, meaning that by default, you cannot reference another pod directly using a domain name; you can only use its IP address. However, pods can receive DNS names under specific conditions, which include the presence of a headless service, as detailed in the documentation. The requirements are as follows:

- The pods must have a `hostname` field.
- The pods must have a `subdomain` field.
- There must be a headless service (within the same namespace) that selects the pods.
- The name of the headless service must match the `subdomain` field of the pods.

When these conditions are met, each pod is assigned a fully-qualified domain name in the format:

`my-hostname.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local`

Here, `my-hostname` corresponds to the `hostname` field of the pod, and `my-subdomain` corresponds to the `subdomain` field of the pod. 

**Note:** The DNS name is generated based on the pod's `hostname`, not its `name`.

You can verify this setup by executing the following commands after applying the configuration:

```bash
kubectl exec -ti my-pod-1 bash
```

From within one of the pods, you should be able to resolve the fully-qualified domain names of both pods:

```bash
host my-hostname-1.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local
host my-hostname-2.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local
```

Since the requests are made from the same namespace as the target pods, you can simplify the domain names to:

```bash
host my-hostname-1.my-subdomain
host my-hostname-2.my-subdomain
```","a/aaaa records kube-dns versions, prior to the implementation of the dns specification , had the following dns resolution:

pod-ipv4-address.my-namespace.pod.cluster-domain.example

.
for example, if a pod in the default namespace has the ip address 172.17.0.3, and the domain name for your cluster is

cluster.local

, then the pod has a dns name:

172-17-0-3.default.pod.cluster.local

.
any pods exposed by a service have the following dns resolution available:

pod-ipv4-address.service-name.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

.
pod's hostname and subdomain fields currently when a pod is created, its hostname (as observed from within the pod) is the pod's

metadata.name

value.
the pod spec has an optional hostname field, which can be used to specify a different hostname.
when specified, it takes precedence over the pod's name to be the hostname of the pod (again, as observed from within the pod).
for example, given a pod with

spec.hostname

set to ""my-host"", the pod will have its hostname set to ""my-host"".
the pod spec also has an optional subdomain field which can be used to indicate that the pod is part of sub-group of the namespace.
for example, a pod with

spec.hostname

set to ""foo"", and

spec.subdomain

set to ""bar"", in namespace ""my-namespace"", will have its hostname set to ""foo"" and its fully qualified domain name (fqdn) set to

""foo.bar.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local""

(once more, as observed from within the pod).
if there exists a headless service in the same namespace as the pod, with the same name as the subdomain, the cluster's dns server also returns a and/or aaaa records for the pod's fully qualified hostname.
example:

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: busybox-subdomain
spec:
  selector:
    name: busybox
  clusterip: none
  ports:
  - name: foo # name is not required for single-port services
    port: 1234

apiversion: v1

    name: busybox
spec:
  hostname: busybox-1

  containers:
  - image: busybox:1.28
    command:
      - sleep
      - ""3600""
    name: busybox

given the above service ""busybox-subdomain"" and the pods which set

spec.subdomain

to ""busybox-subdomain"", the first pod will see its own fqdn as

""busybox-1.busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example""

.
dns serves a and/or aaaa records at that name, pointing to the pod's ip.
both pods ""busybox1"" and ""busybox2"" will have their own address records.
an endpointslice  can specify the dns hostname for any endpoint addresses, along with its ip.
note: a and aaaa records are not created for pod names since hostname is missing for the pod.
a pod with no hostname but with subdomain will only create the a or aaaa record for the headless service (

busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

), pointing to the pods' ip addresses.
also, the pod needs to be ready in order to have a record unless publishnotreadyaddresses=true is set on the service.
pod's sethostnameasfqdn field feature state:

kubernetes v1.22 [stable]

when a pod is configured to have fully qualified domain name (fqdn), its hostname is the short hostname.
for example, if you have a pod with the fully qualified domain name

busybox-1.busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

, then by default the hostname command inside that pod returns busybox-1 and the hostname --fqdn command returns the fqdn.
when you set sethostnameasfqdn: true in the pod spec, the kubelet writes the pod's fqdn into the hostname for that pod's namespace.
in this case, both hostname and hostname --fqdn return the pod's fqdn.
note: in linux, the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname) is limi","to enable pod-to-pod communication using pod hostnames in a job, you must do the following: set up a headless service  with a valid label selector for the pods created by your job.
the headless service must be in the same namespace as the job.
one easy way to do this is to use the job-name: <your-job-name> selector, since the job-name label will be automatically added by kubernetes.
this configuration will trigger the dns system to create records of the hostnames of the pods running your job.
configure the headless service as subdomain service for the job pods by including the following value in your job template spec: subdomain: <headless-svc-name> example below is a working example of a job with pod-to-pod communication via pod hostnames enabled.
the job is completed only after all pods successfully ping each other using hostnames.
note: in the bash script executed on each pod in the example below, the pod hostnames can be prefixed by the namespace as well if the pod needs to be reached from outside the namespace.

            while [ $gotstatus -ne $wantstatus ]
            do                                       
              ping -c 1 example-job-${i}.headless-svc &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
              gotstatus=$?                
              if [ $gotstatus -ne $wantstatus ]; then
                echo ""failed to ping pod example-job-${i}.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...""

            echo ""successfully pinged pod: example-job-${i}.headless-svc""
          done

after applying the example above, reach each other over the network using:

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

.
you should see output similar to the following:

kubectl logs example-job-0-qws42



failed to ping pod example-job-0.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...
successfully pinged pod: example-job-0.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-1.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-2.headless-svc

note: keep in mind that the

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

name format used in this example would not work with dns policy set to none or default.

========================================","you need to have a kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
it is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.
if you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using minikube  or you can use one of these kubernetes playgrounds: killercoda  play with kubernetes  your cluster must be configured to use the coredns addon  or its precursor, kube-dns.
your kubernetes server must be at or later than version v1.6.
to check the version, enter kubectl version.
create a simple pod to use as a test environment admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml

    imagepullpolicy: ifnotpresent
  restartpolicy: always

note: this example creates a pod in the default namespace.
dns name resolution for services depends on the namespace of the pod.
for more information, review dns for services and pods .
use that manifest to create a pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml

pod/dnsutils created …and verify its status:

kubectl get pods dnsutils



name       ready     status    restarts   age
dnsutils   1/1       running   0          &lt;some-time&gt;

once that pod is running, you can exec nslookup in that environment.
if you see something like the following, dns is working correctly.

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10

name:      kubernetes.default
address 1: 10.0.0.1

if the nslookup command fails, check the following: check the local dns configuration first take a look inside the resolv.conf file.
(see customizing dns service  and known issues  below for more information)

kubectl exec -ti dnsutils -- cat /etc/resolv.conf

verify that the search path and name server are set up like the following (note that search path may vary for different cloud providers):

search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local google.internal c.gce_project_id.internal
nameserver 10.0.0.10
options ndots:5

errors such as the following indicate a problem with the coredns (or kube-dns) add-on or with associated services:

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'

or

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'

check if the dns pod is running use the

kubectl get pods

command to verify that the dns pod is running.

kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns



name                       ready     status    restarts   age
...
coredns-7b96bf9f76-5hsxb   1/1       running   0           1h
coredns-7b96bf9f76-mvmmt   1/1       running   0           1h
...

note: the value for label k8s-app is kube-dns for both coredns and kube-dns deployments.
if you see that no coredns pod is running or that the pod has failed/completed, the dns add-on may not be deployed by default in your current environment and you will have to deploy it manually.
check for errors in the dns pod use the kubectl logs command to see logs for the dns containers.
for coredns:

kubectl logs --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

here is an example of a healthy coredns log:

.:53
2018/08/15 14:37:17 [info] coredns-1.2.2

failed to ping pod example-job-0.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...
successfully pinged pod: example-job-0.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-1.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-2.headless-svc

note: keep in mind that the

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

name format used in this example would not work with dns policy set to none or default.
you can learn more about pod dns policies here .
======================================== you need to have a kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
it is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.
if you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using minikube  or you can use one of these kubernetes playgrounds: killercoda  play with kubernetes  your cluster must be configured to use the coredns addon  or its precursor, kube-dns.
your kubernetes server must be at or later than version v1.6.
to check the version, enter kubectl version.
create a simple pod to use as a test environment admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: dnsutils
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: dnsutils
    image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.39
    imagepullpolicy: ifnotpresent
  restartpolicy: always

note: this example creates a pod in the default namespace.
dns name resolution for services depends on the namespace of the pod.
for more information, review dns for services and pods .
use that manifest to create a pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml

pod/dnsutils created …and verify its status:

kubectl get pods dnsutils



name       ready     status    restarts   age
dnsutils   1/1       running   0          &lt;some-time&gt;

once that pod is running, you can exec nslookup in that environment.
if you see something like the following, dns is working correctly.

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10

name:      kubernetes.default
address 1: 10.0.0.1

if the nslookup command fails, check the following: check the local dns configuration first take a look inside the resolv.conf file.
(see customizing dns service  and known issues  below for more information)

kubectl exec -ti dnsutils -- cat /etc/resolv.conf

verify that the search path and name server are set up like the following (note that search path may vary for different cloud providers):

search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local google.internal c.gce_project_id.internal
nameserver 10.0.0.10
options ndots:5

errors such as the following indicate a problem with the coredns (or kube-dns) add-on or with associated services:

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'

or

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'

check if the dns pod is running use the

kubectl get pods

command to verify that the dns pod is running.

kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns



name                       ready     status    restarts   age
...
coredns-7b96bf9f76-5hsxb   1/1       running   0           1h
coredns-7b96bf9f76-mvmmt   1/1       running   0           1h
...

note: the value for label k8s-app is kube-dns for both coredns and kube-dns deployments.
if you see that no coredns pod is running or that the pod has failed/completed, the dns add-on may not be deployed by default in your current environment and you will have to deploy it manually.
check for errors in the dns pod use the kubectl logs command to see logs for the dns containers.
for coredns:

kubectl logs --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

here is an example of a healthy coredns log:

.:53
2018/08/15 14:37:17 [info] coredns-1.2.2
2018/08/15 14:37:17 [info] linux/amd64, go1.10.3, 2e322f6

see if there are any suspicious or unexpected messages in the logs.

### Explanation:
To enable hostname resolution between the two pods, a headless service (`headless-svc`) is created with `clusterIP: None`. The deployment is updated to include the `subdomain` field, which allows the pods to resolve each other's hostnames using the format `<pod-hostname>.<headless-service-name>`. This configuration ensures that the DNS system creates records for the pod hostnames, enabling them to communicate with each other.","```yaml

### Explanation
In summary, the BusyBox image does not come with `kubectl` pre-installed. You can verify this by running the command `kubectl run -i --tty busybox --image=busybox -- sh`, which will start a BusyBox pod with an interactive shell. I recommend using the `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image instead. Additionally, ensure that you have the appropriate RBAC permissions set up, as you may encounter a ""forbidden"" error when trying to access services. The provided YAML configuration includes a Role and RoleBinding to grant the necessary permissions, along with a ServiceAccount and a CronJob that utilizes the `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image to patch a deployment in the specified namespace.","cron jobs require a config file.
here is a manifest for a cronjob that runs a simple demonstration task every minute: application/job/cronjob.yaml

            - -c
            - date; echo hello from the kubernetes cluster
          restartpolicy: onfailure

run the example cronjob by using this command:

kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/job/cronjob.yaml

the output is similar to this:

cronjob.batch/hello created

after creating the cron job, get its status using this command:

kubectl get cronjob hello

the output is similar to this:

name    schedule      suspend   active   last schedule   age
hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        &lt;none&gt;          10s

as you can see from the results of the command, the cron job has not scheduled or run any jobs yet.
watch  for the job to be created in around one minute:

kubectl get jobs --watch

the output is similar to this:

name               completions   duration   age

hello-4111706356   1/1           5s         5s

now you've seen one running job scheduled by the ""hello"" cron job.
you can stop watching the job and view the cron job again to see that it scheduled the job:

kubectl get cronjob hello

hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        50s             75s

you should see that the cron job hello successfully scheduled a job at the time specified in last schedule.
there are currently 0 active jobs, meaning that the job has completed or failed.
now, find the pods that the last scheduled job created and view the standard output of one of the pods.
note: the job name is different from the pod name.

### Explanation
It appears that the ingress definition needs to be updated to the new API version. The `host` entry specified under the `rules` section must correspond to one of the `hosts` entries defined under the `tls` section. This ensures that the ingress is properly configured for SSL termination with the specified secret.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source?

### Explanation:
1. **Localization**: The issue is likely due to the incorrect specification of the `tls` section in the Ingress resource. The `secretName` should be specified correctly, and the `hosts` field must be included.
2. **Reasoning**: The Ingress resource must specify the domain(s) for which the TLS certificate is valid. Without the `hosts` field, the Ingress controller may not associate the TLS secret with the correct domain, leading to the use of default certificates.
3. **Remediation**: The corrected YAML includes the `hosts` field under the `tls` section and specifies the domain in the `rules` section.
4. **Validation**: The YAML syntax is correct, and it adheres to the Kubernetes Ingress schema. Ensure that the domain matches the one for which the TLS certificate was issued.","```yaml

### Explanation
I was able to see the YAML that gets executed by Helm by using the `--dry-run --debug` options at the end of the `helm install` command. During this process, I observed that the controller is executed with the following configuration: `--configmap={namespace-where-the-nginx-ingress-is-deployed}/{name-of-the-helm-chart}-nginx-ingress-controller`. To load your custom ConfigMap, you will need to override it with your own, so make sure to check the namespace. You can find the complete list of configurable properties in the documentation.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source?

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.

### Explanation
To simplify the testing process, I utilized an example from the official Kubernetes documentation, making minor adjustments to demonstrate various scenarios. I can confirm that when `backoffLimit` is set to 0 and `restartPolicy` is set to Never, the behavior is as expected, with no retries occurring. It's important to note that each execution of your job, which in this case is scheduled to run every 60 seconds (`schedule: ""*/1 * * * *""`), is not considered a retry.

Let's examine the following example (base YAML available here):

This configuration spawns a new CronJob every 60 seconds according to the schedule, regardless of whether it fails or succeeds. In this specific instance, it is set to fail since we are attempting to execute a non-existent command.

You can observe the status by running:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1587558720-pgqq9   0/1     Error               0          61s
hello-1587558780-gpzxl   0/1     ContainerCreating    0          1s
```

As shown, there are no retries. Even though the first pod failed, a new one is created exactly 60 seconds later as specified. I want to emphasize that this is not a retry.

Conversely, if we modify the example to set `backoffLimit: 3`, we can observe retries in action. In this case, new pods are created more frequently than every 60 seconds, indicating retries.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1587565260-7db6j   0/1     Error    0          106s
hello-1587565260-tcqhv   0/1     Error    0          104s
hello-1587565260-vnbcl   0/1     Error    0          94s
hello-1587565320-7nc6z   0/1     Error    0          44s
hello-1587565320-l4p8r   0/1     Error    0          14s
hello-1587565320-mjnb6   0/1     Error    0          46s
hello-1587565320-wqbm2   0/1     Error    0          34s
```

Here, we see three retries (pod creation attempts) associated with the `hello-1587565260` job and four retries (including the original attempt, which is not counted in the `backoffLimit: 3`) related to the `hello-1587565320` job.

The jobs themselves continue to run according to the schedule, at 60-second intervals:

```bash
kubectl get jobs
NAME               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
hello-1587565260   0/1           2m12s      2m12s
hello-1587565320   0/1           72s        72s
hello-1587565380   0/1           11s        11s
```

However, due to the `backoffLimit` set to 3, every time the pod responsible for executing the job fails, three additional retries are initiated.

I hope this clarifies any potential confusion regarding the operation of CronJobs in Kubernetes. If you're interested in executing a task just once rather than at regular intervals, consider using a simple Job instead of a CronJob. Additionally, if you wish to run this specific job regularly but less frequently, such as once every 24 hours, you may want to adjust your Cron configuration accordingly.","with the following example, you can learn how to use pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary pod restarts when a pod failure indicates a non-retriable software bug.
first, create a job based on the config: /controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob.yaml

        args:
        - -c
        - echo ""hello world! i'm going to exit with 42 to simulate a software bug."" &amp;&amp; sleep 30 &amp;&amp; exit 42
  backofflimit: 6
  podfailurepolicy:
    rules:
    - action: failjob
      onexitcodes:
        containername: main
        operator: in
        values: [42]

by running:

kubectl create -f job-pod-failure-policy-failjob.yaml

after around 30s the entire job should be terminated.
inspect the status of the job by running:

kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-failjob -o yaml

in the job status, the following conditions display: failuretarget condition: has a reason field set to podfailurepolicy and a message field with more information about the termination, like

container main for pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob-8ckj8 failed with exit code 42 matching failjob rule at index 0

.
the job controller adds this condition as soon as the job is considered a failure.
for details, see termination of job pods .
failed condition: same reason and message as the failuretarget condition.
the job controller adds this condition after all of the job's pods are terminated.
for comparison, if the pod failure policy was disabled it would take 6 retries of the pod, taking at least 2 minutes.
clean up delete the job you created:

kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob

the cluster automatically cleans up the pods.
========================================","with the following example, you can learn how to use pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary pod restarts based on custom pod conditions.
note: the example below works since version 1.27 as it relies on transitioning of deleted pods, in the pending phase, to a terminal phase (see: pod phase ).
first, create a job based on the config: /controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml 

apiversion: batch/v1
kind: job
metadata:
  name: job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue
spec:

  backofflimit: 6
  podfailurepolicy:
    rules:
    - action: failjob
      onpodconditions:
      - type: configissue

by running:

kubectl create -f job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml

note that, the image is misconfigured, as it does not exist.
inspect the status of the job's pods by running:

kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml

you will see output similar to this:

containerstatuses:
- image: non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example
   ...
   state:
   waiting:
      message: back-off pulling image ""non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example""
      reason: imagepullbackoff
      ...
phase: pending

note that the pod remains in the pending phase as it fails to pull the misconfigured image.
this, in principle, could be a transient issue and the image could get pulled.
however, in this case, the image does not exist so we indicate this fact by a custom condition.
add the custom condition.
first prepare the patch by running:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt; patch.yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - type: configissue
    status: ""true""
    reason: ""nonexistingimage""
    lasttransitiontime: ""$(date -u +""%y-%m-%dt%h:%m:%sz"")""
eof

second, select one of the pods created by the job by running:

podname=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

then, apply the patch on one of the pods by running the following command:

kubectl patch pod $podname --subresource=status --patch-file=patch.yaml

if applied successfully, you will get a notification like this: pod/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp patched delete the pod to transition it to failed phase, by running the command:

kubectl delete pods/$podname

inspect the status of the job by running:

kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml

in the job status, see a job failed condition with the field reason equal podfailurepolicy.
additionally, the message field contains a more detailed information about the job termination, such as:

pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp has condition configissue matching failjob rule at index 0

.
note: in a production environment, the steps 3 and 4 should be automated by a user-provided controller.
cleaning up delete the job you created:

kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue

the cluster automatically cleans up the pods.
========================================","you could rely solely on the pod backoff failure policy , by specifying the job's

.spec.backofflimit

field.
however, in many situations it is problematic to find a balance between setting a low value for

.spec.backofflimit

to avoid unnecessary pod retries, yet high enough to make sure the job would not be terminated by pod disruptions.

kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob

the cluster automatically cleans up the pods.
======================================== with the following example, you can learn how to use pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary pod restarts based on custom pod conditions.
note: the example below works since version 1.27 as it relies on transitioning of deleted pods, in the pending phase, to a terminal phase (see: pod phase ).
first, create a job based on the config: /controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml 

apiversion: batch/v1
kind: job
metadata:
  name: job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue
spec:
  completions: 8
  parallelism: 2
  template:
    spec:
      restartpolicy: never
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: ""non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example""
  backofflimit: 6
  podfailurepolicy:
    rules:
    - action: failjob
      onpodconditions:
      - type: configissue

by running:

kubectl create -f job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml

note that, the image is misconfigured, as it does not exist.
inspect the status of the job's pods by running:

kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml

you will see output similar to this:

containerstatuses:
- image: non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example
   ...
   state:
   waiting:
      message: back-off pulling image ""non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example""
      reason: imagepullbackoff
      ...
phase: pending

note that the pod remains in the pending phase as it fails to pull the misconfigured image.
this, in principle, could be a transient issue and the image could get pulled.
however, in this case, the image does not exist so we indicate this fact by a custom condition.
add the custom condition.
first prepare the patch by running:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt; patch.yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - type: configissue
    status: ""true""
    reason: ""nonexistingimage""
    lasttransitiontime: ""$(date -u +""%y-%m-%dt%h:%m:%sz"")""
eof

second, select one of the pods created by the job by running:

podname=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

then, apply the patch on one of the pods by running the following command:

kubectl patch pod $podname --subresource=status --patch-file=patch.yaml

if applied successfully, you will get a notification like this: pod/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp patched delete the pod to transition it to failed phase, by running the command:

kubectl delete pods/$podname

inspect the status of the job by running:

kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml

in the job status, see a job failed condition with the field reason equal podfailurepolicy.
additionally, the message field contains a more detailed information about the job termination, such as:

pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp has condition configissue matching failjob rule at index 0

.
note: in a production environment, the steps 3 and 4 should be automated by a user-provided controller.
cleaning up delete the job you created:

kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue

the cluster automatically cleans up the pods.
======================================== you could rely solely on the pod backoff failure policy , by specifying the job's

.spec.backofflimit

field.
however, in many situations it is problematic to find a balance between setting a low value for

.spec.backofflimit

to avoid unnecessary pod retries, yet high enough to make sure the job would not be terminated by pod disruptions.

### Explanation
To begin with, you need to set up the Redis service as a ClusterIP service, which will make it accessible only to other services within the cluster. This can be achieved by omitting the line that specifies the service type. 

When configuring your API to connect to Redis, you should use the address `app-api-redis-svc:6379`. 

That's all there is to it! I have numerous services that communicate with each other in this manner. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out in the comments.","# create a service for a replicated nginx, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose rc nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # create a service for a replication controller identified by type and name specified in ""nginx-controller.yaml"", which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose -f nginx-controller.yaml --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # create a service for a pod valid-pod, which serves on port 444 with the name ""frontend""
  kubectl expose pod valid-pod --port=444 --name=frontend
  
  # create a second service based on the above service, exposing the container port 8443 as port 443 with the name ""nginx-https""
  kubectl expose service nginx --port=443 --target-port=8443 --name=nginx-https
  
  # create a service for a replicated streaming application on port 4100 balancing udp traffic and named 'video-stream'.
  kubectl expose rc streamer --port=4100 --protocol=udp --name=video-stream
  
  # create a service for a replicated nginx using replica set, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose rs nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # create a service for an nginx deployment, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

note: this manifest file creates a service named redis-leader with a set of labels that match the labels previously defined, so the service routes network traffic to the redis pod.

### Explanation
The capability to autoscale StatefulSets using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) was introduced in Kubernetes version 1.9, which means that earlier versions do not support this feature. If you are using Kubernetes 1.9 or later, you can implement autoscaling for your StatefulSets as shown in the YAML example above. For further details, you can refer to the following link:

horizontalpodautoscaler controls the scale of a deployment and its replicaset kubernetes implements horizontal pod autoscaling as a control loop that runs intermittently (it is not a continuous process).
the interval is set by the --horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period parameter to the kube-controller-manager  (and the default interval is 15 seconds).
once during each period, the controller manager queries the resource utilization against the metrics specified in each horizontalpodautoscaler definition.
the controller manager finds the target resource defined by the scaletargetref, then selects the pods based on the target resource's

.spec.selector

labels, and obtains the metrics from either the resource metrics api (for per-pod resource metrics), or the custom metrics api (for all other metrics).
for per-pod resource metrics (like cpu), the controller fetches the metrics from the resource metrics api for each pod targeted by the horizontalpodautoscaler.
then, if a target utilization value is set, the controller calculates the utilization value as a percentage of the equivalent resource request  on the containers in each pod.
if a target raw value is set, the raw metric values are used directly.
the controller then takes the mean of the utilization or the raw value (depending on the type of target specified) across all targeted pods, and produces a ratio used to scale the number of desired replicas.
please note that if some of the pod's containers do not have the relevant resource request set, cpu utilization for the pod will not be defined and the autoscaler will not take any action for that metric.
see the algorithm details  section below for more information about how the autoscaling algorithm works.
for per-pod custom metrics, the controller functions similarly to per-pod resource metrics, except that it works with raw values, not utilization values.
for object metrics and external metrics, a single metric is fetched, which describes the object in question.
this metric is compared to the target value, to produce a ratio as above.
in the autoscaling/v2 api version, this value can optionally be divided by the number of pods before the comparison is made.
the common use for horizontalpodautoscaler is to configure it to fetch metrics from aggregated apis  (

metrics.k8s.io

,

custom.metrics.k8s.io

, or

external.metrics.k8s.io

).

api is usually provided by an add-on named metrics server, which needs to be launched separately.
for more information about resource metrics, see metrics server .
support for metrics apis  explains the stability guarantees and support status for these different apis.
the horizontalpodautoscaler controller accesses corresponding workload resources that support scaling (such as deployments and statefulset).

(the autoscaling/v2beta2 api version previously provided this ability as a beta feature) provided that you use the autoscaling/v2 api version, you can specify multiple metrics for a horizontalpodautoscaler to scale on.
then, the horizontalpodautoscaler controller evaluates each metric, and proposes a new scale based on that metric.
the horizontalpodautoscaler takes the maximum scale recommended for each metric and sets the workload to that size (provided that this isn't larger than the overall maximum that you configured).
========================================","any hpa target can be scaled based on the resource usage of the pods in the scaling target.
when defining the pod specification the resource requests like cpu and memory should be specified.
this is used to determine the resource utilization and used by the hpa controller to scale the target up or down.
to use resource utilization based scaling specify a metric source like this:

type: resource
resource:
  name: cpu
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60

with this metric the hpa controller will keep the average utilization of the pods in the scaling target at 60%.
utilization is the ratio between the current usage of resource to the requested resources of the pod.
see algorithm  for more details about how the utilization is calculated and averaged.
note: since the resource usages of all the containers are summed up the total pod utilization may not accurately represent the individual container resource usage.
this could lead to situations where a single container might be running with high usage and the hpa will not scale out because the overall pod usage is still within acceptable limits.
container resource metrics feature state:

kubernetes v1.30 [stable]

(enabled by default: true) the horizontalpodautoscaler api also supports a container metric source where the hpa can track the resource usage of individual containers across a set of pods, in order to scale the target resource.
this lets you configure scaling thresholds for the containers that matter most in a particular pod.
for example, if you have a web application and a sidecar container that provides logging, you can scale based on the resource use of the web application, ignoring the sidecar container and its resource use.
if you revise the target resource to have a new pod specification with a different set of containers, you should revise the hpa spec if that newly added container should also be used for scaling.
if the specified container in the metric source is not present or only present in a subset of the pods then those pods are ignored and the recommendation is recalculated.
see algorithm  for more details about the calculation.
to use container resources for autoscaling define a metric source as follows:

type: containerresource
containerresource:
  name: cpu
  container: application
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60

in the above example the hpa controller scales the target such that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is 60%.
note: if you change the name of a container that a horizontalpodautoscaler is tracking, you can make that change in a specific order to ensure scaling remains available and effective whilst the change is being applied.
before you update the resource that defines the container (such as a deployment), you should update the associated hpa to track both the new and old container names.
this way, the hpa is able to calculate a scaling recommendation throughout the update process.
once you have rolled out the container name change to the workload resource, tidy up by removing the old container name from the hpa specification.

### Explanation
I have conducted several tests involving `IngressClass`, `Ingress`, and the NGINX Ingress Controller. Here are the scenarios I explored:

**Scenario 1:**
- Custom-named `IngressClass`
- NGINX Ingress Controller with the default `--ingress-class` set to `nginx`
- `Ingress` using the same name for `ingressClassName`

**Output:** Response 404

**Scenario 2:**
- Custom-named `IngressClass`
- NGINX Ingress Controller with `--ingress-class` set to `ingress-test`
- `Ingress` using the same name for `ingressClassName`

**Output:** Response 404

**Scenario 3:**
- `IngressClass` named `test`
- NGINX Ingress Controller with `--ingress-class` set to `test`
- `Ingress` using `test` in `ingressClassName`

**Output:** Proper response

**Scenario 4:**
- `IngressClass` named `nginx`
- NGINX Ingress Controller with `--ingress-class` set to `nginx`
- `Ingress` using `nginx` in `ingressClassName`

**Output:** Proper response

**Conclusion:**
It's important to note that there are three types of NGINX: the open-source NGINX Ingress Controller (which you are likely using), NGINX Inc., and NGINX Inc. Plus. In one of my scenarios, when I specified `spec.controller: nginx.org/ingress-controller` with the NGINX Ingress Controller using `--ingress-class=nginx`, the NGINX Ingress Controller pod entered a crash loop. The logs indicated an invalid `IngressClass` (spec.controller) value of ""nginx.org/ingress-controller"", which should be ""k8s.io/ingress-nginx"".

To replicate this behavior, you need to deploy an `IngressClass` with the specific controller and then deploy NGINX. 

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: IngressClass
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  controller: nginx.org/ingress-controller
```

After deploying the NGINX Ingress Controller, the controller pod will be in a crash loop state. The logs will show an error indicating that the `spec.controller` value is invalid. It only works when the `IngressClass` name is set to `nginx`. 

I would suggest that `nginx.org/ingress-controller` is intended for NGINX Inc. and `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` is for the open-source NGINX Ingress. If a custom value is used for the `--ingress-class` argument in the controller deployment manifest, the presence or absence of an `IngressClass` object with the same name does not affect cluster behavior, as long as the `ingressClassName` in the `Ingress` spec matches the controller argument. Furthermore, if the `IngressClass` is present, the `spec.controller` can have any value that matches the required ""domain-like"" pattern without impacting the `Ingress` workflow.

Additionally, the `Ingress` functions correctly if the correct value for the `ingress-class` is set either in the `spec.ingressClassName` property or in the `metadata.annotations.kubernetes.io/ingress.class`. However, if both values are set in the same `Ingress` object, it will result in an error:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
```

The error message will indicate that the `Ingress` ""test-ingress"" is invalid because the annotation and the class field cannot be set simultaneously. Please note that this was tested only with the NGINX Ingress Controller. If you plan to use `IngressClass` with other controllers like Traefik or Ambassador, be sure to check their release notes for compatibility.","ingresses can be implemented by different controllers, often with different configuration.
each ingress should specify a class, a reference to an ingressclass resource that contains additional configuration including the name of the controller that should implement the class.

the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a cluster-scoped api (possibly a custom resource), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific cluster scoped resource for that api.

the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a namespaced api (for example: configmap), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific resource in the namespace you specified in namespace.
namespace-scoped parameters help the cluster operator delegate control over the configuration (for example: load balancer settings, api gateway definition) that is used for a workload.
if you used a cluster-scoped parameter then either: the cluster operator team needs to approve a different team's changes every time there's a new configuration change being applied.
the cluster operator must define specific access controls, such as rbac  roles and bindings, that let the application team make changes to the cluster-scoped parameters resource.
the ingressclass api itself is always cluster-scoped.

deprecated annotation before the ingressclass resource and ingressclassname field were added in kubernetes 1.18, ingress classes were specified with a

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

### Explanation
The first label is designated for the deployment itself, providing a specific label for that deployment. For instance, if you wish to delete the deployment, you can execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment -l app=nginx
```

This command will remove the entire deployment.

The second label is the selector, specifically `matchLabels`, which instructs resources (like services) to match pods based on their labels. For example, if you want to create a service that targets all pods labeled with `app=nginx`, you would use the definition provided above.

The service will search for the specified `matchLabels` and bind to the pods that have the label `app: nginx` assigned to them.

The third label pertains to the pod template labels. The template refers to the pod template that describes the pods to be launched. For instance, if you have a deployment with two replicas, Kubernetes will create two pods with the labels specified in the template's `metadata.labels`. This distinction is subtle but significant, as it allows for different labels for the deployment and the pods generated by that deployment.","the following is an example of a deployment.
it creates a replicaset to bring up three nginx pods: controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml

this name will become the basis for the replicasets and pods which are created later.

the deployment creates a replicaset that creates three replicated pods, indicated by the

.spec.replicas

field.
the

.spec.selector

field defines how the created replicaset finds which pods to manage.
in this case, you select a label that is defined in the pod template (app: nginx).
however, more sophisticated selection rules are possible, as long as the pod template itself satisfies the rule.
note: the

.spec.selector.matchlabels

field is a map of {key,value} pairs.
a single {key,value} in the matchlabels map is equivalent to an element of matchexpressions, whose key field is ""key"", the operator is ""in"", and the values array contains only ""value"".
all of the requirements, from both matchlabels and matchexpressions, must be satisfied in order to match.
the

.spec.template

field contains the following sub-fields: the pods are labeled app: nginxusing the

.metadata.labels

field.
the pod template's specification, or

.spec

field, indicates that the pods run one container, nginx, which runs the nginx docker hub  image at version 1.14.2.
create one container and name it nginx using the

.spec.containers[0].name

field.
before you begin, make sure your kubernetes cluster is up and running.
follow the steps given below to create the above deployment: create the deployment by running the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml

run

kubectl get deployments

to check if the deployment was created.
if the deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:

name               ready   up-to-date   available   age
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s

when you inspect the deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed: name lists the names of the deployments in the namespace.
ready displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
it follows the pattern ready/desired.
up-to-date displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
available displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
age displays the amount of time that the application has been running.
notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to

.spec.replicas

field.
to see the deployment rollout status, run

kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

.
the output is similar to:

waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...

notice that the deployment has created all three replicas, and all replicas are up-to-date (they contain the latest pod template) and available.
to see the replicaset (rs) created by the deployment, run

kubectl get rs

### Explanation
Secrets are designed to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords and private keys, while ConfigMaps are intended for non-sensitive configuration data. According to the documentation, a Secret is an object that holds a small amount of sensitive data, like a password, token, or key. On the other hand, a ConfigMap allows you to separate environment-specific configurations from your container images, making your applications more portable.

You can create a Secret and mount it as one or more files in your Pods. Below is a simple example demonstrating how this works. The sample includes a Secret manifest file and a Deployment that utilizes this Secret. Note that I used `subPath` with the Secrets, and it functions as expected.

Before deploying, ensure that the Secret is created. After creating both the Secret and Deployment, you can verify their functionality with the following commands:

```bash
$ kubectl get secret,deploy,pod
```

This will show the status of the Secret, Deployment, and Pod. You can also check the contents of the mounted files using:

```bash
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- ls /mnt
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat /mnt/secret.file1
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat /mnt/secret.file2
```

### Projected Volume
A more effective approach to achieve your goal is to use a projected volume. A projected volume allows you to map multiple existing volume sources into the same directory. The documentation provides a detailed explanation, but I have also created an example to illustrate how it works. In this example, I mounted `secret.file1`, `secret.file2` from a Secret, and `config.file1` from a ConfigMap as files within the Pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
data:
  secret.file1: |
    c2vjcmv0rmlsztek
  secret.file2: |
    c2vjcmv0rmlsztik

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: all-in-one
      mountPath: ""/config-volume""
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: my-secret
          items:
            - key: secret.file1
              path: secret-dir1/secret.file1
            - key: secret.file2
              path: secret-dir2/secret.file2
      - configMap:
          name: my-config
          items:
            - key: config.file1
              path: config-dir1/config.file1
```

You can verify the functionality of this setup with the following commands:

```bash
$ kubectl exec nginx -- ls /config-volume
$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/config-dir1/config.file1
$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/secret-dir1/secret.file1
$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/secret-dir2/secret.file2
```

get a shell into the container that is running in your pod:

kubectl exec -i -t secret-test-pod -- /bin/bash

the secret data is exposed to the container through a volume mounted under /etc/secret-volume.
in your shell, list the files in the /etc/secret-volume directory:

# run this in the shell inside the container
ls /etc/secret-volume

the output shows two files, one for each piece of secret data: password username in your shell, display the contents of the username and password files:

# run this in the shell inside the container
echo ""$( cat /etc/secret-volume/username )""
echo ""$( cat /etc/secret-volume/password )""

the output is your username and password: my-app 39528$vdg7jb modify your image or command line so that the program looks for files in the mountpath directory.
each key in the secret data map becomes a file name in this directory.
project secret keys to specific file paths you can also control the paths within the volume where secret keys are projected.
use the

.spec.volumes[].secret.items

field to change the target path of each key:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      items:
      - key: username
        path: my-group/my-username

when you deploy this pod, the following happens: the username key from mysecret is available to the container at the path /etc/foo/my-group/my-username instead of at /etc/foo/username.
the password key from that secret object is not projected.
if you list keys explicitly using

.spec.volumes[].secret.items

, consider the following: only keys specified in items are projected.
to consume all keys from the secret, all of them must be listed in the items field.
all listed keys must exist in the corresponding secret.
otherwise, the volume is not created.
set posix permissions for secret keys you can set the posix file access permission bits for a single secret key.
if you don't specify any permissions, 0644 is used by default.
you can also set a default posix file mode for the entire secret volume, and you can override per key if needed.
for example, you can specify a default mode like this:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      defaultmode: 0400

the secret is mounted on /etc/foo; all the files created by the secret volume mount have permission 0400.
note: if you're defining a pod or a pod template using json, beware that the json specification doesn't support octal literals for numbers because json considers 0400 to be the decimal value 400.
in json, use decimal values for the defaultmode instead.
if you're writing yaml, you can write the defaultmode in octal.
========================================","creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.
secret/optional-secret.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      optional: true

by default, secrets are required.
none of a pod's containers will start until all non-optional secrets are available.
if a pod references a specific key in a non-optional secret and that secret does exist, but is missing the named key, the pod fails during startup.
using secrets as files from a pod if you want to access data from a secret in a pod, one way to do that is to have kubernetes make the value of that secret be available as a file inside the filesystem of one or more of the pod's containers.
for instructions, refer to create a pod that has access to the secret data through a volume .
when a volume contains data from a secret, and that secret is updated, kubernetes tracks this and updates the data in the volume, using an eventually-consistent approach.
note: a container using a secret as a subpath  volume mount does not receive automated secret updates.
the kubelet keeps a cache of the curren","you can use secrets for purposes such as the following: set environment variables for a container .
provide credentials such as ssh keys or passwords to pods .
allow the kubelet to pull container images from private registries .
the kubernetes control plane also uses secrets; for example, bootstrap token secrets  are a mechanism to help automate node registration.
use case: dotfiles in a secret volume you can make your data ""hidden"" by defining a key that begins with a dot.
this key represents a dotfile or ""hidden"" file.
for example, when the following secret is mounted into a volume, secret-volume, the volume will contain a single file, called

.secret-file

, and the dotfile-test-container will have this file present at the path

/etc/secret-volume/.secret-file

.
note: files beginning with dot characters are hidden from the output of ls -l; you must use ls -la to see them when listing directory contents.
secret/dotfile-secret.yaml

        - ls
        - ""-l""
        - ""/etc/secret-volume""
      volumemounts:
        - name: secret-volume
          readonly: true
          mountpath: ""/etc/secret-volume""

use case: secret visible to one container in a pod consider a program that needs to handle http requests, do some complex business logic, and then sign some messages with an hmac.
because it has complex application logic, there might be an unnoticed remote file reading exploit in the server, which could expose the private key to an attacker.
this could be divided into two processes in two containers: a frontend container which handles user interaction and business logic, but which cannot see the private key; and a signer container that can see the private key, and responds to simple signing requests from the frontend (for example, over localhost networking).
with this partitioned approach, an attacker now has to trick the application server into doing something rather arbitrary, which may be harder than getting it to read a file.
alternatives to secrets rather than using a secret to protect confidential data, you can pick from alternatives.
here are some of your options: if your cloud-native component needs to authenticate to another application that you know is running within the same kubernetes cluster, you can use a serviceaccount  and its tokens to identify your client.
there are third-party tools that you can run, either within or outside your cluster, that manage sensitive data.
for example, a service that pods access over https, that reveals a secret if the client correctly authenticates (for example, with a serviceaccount token).
for authentication, you can implement a custom signer for x.509 certificates, and use certificatesigningrequests  to let that custom signer issue certificates to pods that need them.
you can use a device plugin  to expose node-local encryption hardware to a specific pod.
for example, you can schedule trusted pods onto nodes that provide a trusted platform module, configured out-of-band.
you can also combine two or more of those options, including the option to use secret objects themselves.
for example: implement (or deploy) an operator  that fetches short-lived session tokens from an external service, and then creates secrets based on those short-lived session tokens.
pods running in your cluster can make use of the session tokens, and operator ensures they are valid.
this separation means that you can run pods that are unaware of the exact mechanisms for issuing and refreshing those session tokens.

### Explanation
For anyone who might come across this post, I realized that I needed to include this as my HTTP paths, and it's important to note that this should be the first specified path. Once I added this redirection, it started functioning correctly. The final configuration in question should reflect the changes made to the Ingress resource, transitioning from the deprecated `extensions/v1beta1` to the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API version. The notable adjustments include the use of `pathType` to explicitly define the path behavior and the updated structure for specifying service backends.","official document: in some scenarios the exposed url in the backend service differs from the specified path in the ingress rule. without a rewrite any request will return 404. set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` to the path expected by the service.  if the application root is exposed in a different path and needs to be redirected, set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root` to redirect requests for `/`.  !!! example     please check the [rewrite](../../examples/rewrite/readme.md) example. github pages: this example demonstrates how to use rewrite annotations. prerequisites you will need to make sure your ingress targets exactly one ingress controller by specifying the ingress.class annotation, and that you have an ingress controller running in your cluster. deployment rewriting can be controlled using the following annotations name description values nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target target uri where the traffic must be redirected string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iossl-redirect indicates if the location section is only accessible via ssl defaults to true when ingress contains a certificate bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioforce-ssl-redirect forces the redirection to https even if the ingress is not tls enabled bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root defines the application root that the controller must redirect if its in context string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex indicates if the paths defined on an ingress use regular expressions bool. create an ingress rule with a rewrite annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex true nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target 2 name rewrite namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host rewrite.bar.com http paths - path something. pathtype implementationspecific backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - in this ingress definition, any characters captured by . will be assigned to the placeholder 2, which is then used as a parameter in the rewrite-target annotation. for example, the ingress definition above will result in the following rewrites rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomethingnew rewrites to rewrite.bar.comnew app root create an ingress rule with an app-root annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root app1 name approot namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host approot.bar.com http paths - path pathtype prefix backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - check the rewrite is working curl -i -k httpapproot.bar.com http1.1 302 moved temporarily server nginx1.11.10 date mon, 13 mar 2017 145715 gmt content-type texthtml content-length 162 location httpapproot.bar.comapp1 connection keep-alive. medium website: example 1 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target destination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one does a transparent reverse proxy. it does not update the location header so the url in the browser does not change. example 2 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target httpsnginx.redirectdestination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one changes the location header and the url in the browser is updated http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsource location httpsnginx.redirectdestination http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsourcebar location httpsnginx.redirectdestinationbar this is because the replacement string as specified in rewrite-target an","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id"";

```

### Explanation
Surprisingly, this configuration works! I tested it on my cluster by adding a fake registry credentials secret with incorrect values. I included both secrets in my YAML file as you did, and the pods were created successfully, with the container running without issues. The `regcred` secret contains the correct values, while `regcred-test` is just a random string. This demonstrates that Kubernetes ignores the invalid secret and still allows the deployment to proceed.","you can use secrets for purposes such as the following: set environment variables for a container .
provide credentials such as ssh keys or passwords to pods .
allow the kubelet to pull container images from private registries .
the kubernetes control plane also uses secrets; for example, bootstrap token secrets  are a mechanism to help automate node registration.
use case: dotfiles in a secret volume you can make your data ""hidden"" by defining a key that begins with a dot.
this key represents a dotfile or ""hidden"" file.
for example, when the following secret is mounted into a volume, secret-volume, the volume will contain a single file, called

.secret-file

, and the dotfile-test-container will have this file present at the path

/etc/secret-volume/.secret-file

.
note: files beginning with dot characters are hidden from the output of ls -l; you must use ls -la to see them when listing directory contents.

      image: registry.k8s.io/busybox
      command:
        - ls
        - ""-l""
        - ""/etc/secret-volume""
      volumemounts:
        - name: secret-volume
          readonly: true
          mountpath: ""/etc/secret-volume""

use case: secret visible to one container in a pod consider a program that needs to handle http requests, do some complex business logic, and then sign some messages with an hmac.
because it has complex application logic, there might be an unnoticed remote file reading exploit in the server, which could expose the private key to an attacker.
this could be divided into two processes in two containers: a frontend container which handles user interaction and business logic, but which cannot see the private key; and a signer container that can see the private key, and responds to simple signing requests from the frontend (for example, over localhost networking).
with this partitioned approach, an attacker now has to trick the application server into doing something rather arbitrary, which may be harder than getting it to read a file.
alternatives to secrets rather than using a secret to protect confidential data, you can pick from alternatives.
here are some of your options: if your cloud-native component needs to authenticate to another application that you know is running within the same kubernetes cluster, you can use a serviceaccount  and its tokens to identify your client.
there are third-party tools that you can run, either within or outside your cluster, that manage sensitive data.
for example, a service that pods access over https, that reveals a secret if the client correctly authenticates (for example, with a serviceaccount token).
for authentication, you can implement a custom signer for x.509 certificates, and use certificatesigningrequests  to let that custom signer issue certificates to pods that need them.
you can use a device plugin  to expose node-local encryption hardware to a specific pod.
for example, you can schedule trusted pods onto nodes that provide a trusted platform module, configured out-of-band.
you can also combine two or more of those options, including the option to use secret objects themselves.
for example: implement (or deploy) an operator  that fetches short-lived session tokens from an external service, and then creates secrets based on those short-lived session tokens.
pods running in your cluster can make use of the session tokens, and operator ensures they are valid.
this separation means that you can run pods that are unaware of the exact mechanisms for issuing and refreshing those session tokens.
========================================","creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.
secret/optional-secret.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      optional: true

by default, secrets are required.
none of a pod's containers will start until all non-optional secrets are available.
if a pod references a specific key in a non-optional secret and that secret does exist, but is missing the named key, the pod fails during startup.
using secrets as files from a pod if you want to access data from a secret in a pod, one way to do that is to have kubernetes make the value of that secret be available as a file inside the filesystem of one or more of the pod's containers.
for instructions, refer to create a pod that has access to the secret data through a volume .
when a volume contains data from a secret, and that secret is updated, kubernetes tracks this and updates the data in the volume, using an eventually-consistent approach.
note: a container using a secret as a subpath  volume mount does not receive automated secret updates.
the kubelet keeps a cache of the curren","private registries may require keys to read images from them.
credentials can be provided in several ways: configuring nodes to authenticate to a private registry all pods can read any configured private registries requires node configuration by cluster administrator kubelet credential provider to dynamically fetch credentials for private registries kubelet can be configured to use credential provider exec plugin for the respective private registry.
pre-pulled images all pods can use any images cached on a node requires root access to all nodes to set up specifying imagepullsecrets on a pod only pods which provide their own keys can access the private registry vendor-specific or local extensions if you're using a custom node configuration, you (or your cloud provider) can implement your mechanism for authenticating the node to the container registry.
these options are explained in more detail below.
configuring nodes to authenticate to a private registry specific instructions for setting credentials depends on the container runtime and registry you chose to use.
you should refer to your solution's documentation for the most accurate information.
for an example of configuring a private container image registry, see the pull an image from a private registry  task.
that example uses a private registry in docker hub.
kubelet credential provider for authenticated image pulls note: this approach is especially suitable when kubelet needs to fetch registry credentials dynamically.
most commonly used for registries provided by cloud providers where auth tokens are short-lived.
you can configure the kubelet to invoke a plugin binary to dynamically fetch registry credentials for a container image.
this is the most robust and versatile way to fetch credentials for private registries, but also requires kubelet-level configuration to enable.
see configure a kubelet image credential provider  for more details.
interpretation of config.json the interpretation of

config.json

varies between the original docker implementation and the kubernetes interpretation.
in docker, the auths keys can only specify root urls, whereas kubernetes allows glob urls as well as prefix-matched paths.
the only limitation is that glob patterns (*) have to include the dot (

.

) for each subdomain.
the amount of matched subdomains has to be equal to the amount of glob patterns (

*.

), for example:

*.kubernetes.io

will not match

kubernetes.io

, but

abc.kubernetes.io



*.*.kubernetes.io

will not match

abc.kubernetes.io

, but

abc.def.kubernetes.io



prefix.*.io

will match

prefix.kubernetes.io



*-good.kubernetes.io

will match

prefix-good.kubernetes.io

this means that a

config.json

like this is valid:

{
    ""auths"": {
        ""my-registry.io/images"": { ""auth"": ""…"" },
        ""*.my-registry.io/images"": { ""auth"": ""…"" }
    }
}

image pull operations would now pass the credentials to the cri container runtime for every valid pattern.
for example the following container image names would match successfully:

my-registry.io/images



my-registry.io/images/my-image



my-registry.io/images/another-image



sub.my-registry.io/images/my-image

but not:

a.sub.my-registry.io/images/my-image



a.b.sub.my-registry.io/images/my-image

the kubelet performs image pulls sequentially for every found credential.
this means, that multiple entries in

config.json

for different paths are possible, too:

{
    ""auths"": {
        ""my-registry.io/images"": {
            ""auth"": ""…""
        },
        ""my-registry.io/images/subpath"": {
            ""auth"": ""…""
        }
    }
}

if now a container specifies an image

my-registry.io/images/subpath/my-image

to be pulled, then the kubelet will try to download them from both authentication sources if one of them fails.
pre-pulled images note: this approach is suitable if you can control node configuration.
it will not work reliably if your cloud provider manages nodes and replaces them auto","you can use secrets for purposes such as the following: set environment variables for a container .
provide credentials such as ssh keys or passwords to pods .
allow the kubelet to pull container images from private registries .
the kubernetes control plane also uses secrets; for example, bootstrap token secrets  are a mechanism to help automate node registration.
use case: dotfiles in a secret volume you can make your data ""hidden"" by defining a key that begins with a dot.
this key represents a dotfile or ""hidden"" file.
for example, when the following secret is mounted into a volume, secret-volume, the volume will contain a single file, called

.secret-file

, and the dotfile-test-container will have this file present at the path

/etc/secret-volume/.secret-file

.
note: files beginning with dot characters are hidden from the output of ls -l; you must use ls -la to see them when listing directory contents.

        - name: secret-volume
          readonly: true
          mountpath: ""/etc/secret-volume""

use case: secret visible to one container in a pod consider a program that needs to handle http requests, do some complex business logic, and then sign some messages with an hmac.
because it has complex application logic, there might be an unnoticed remote file reading exploit in the server, which could expose the private key to an attacker.
this could be divided into two processes in two containers: a frontend container which handles user interaction and business logic, but which cannot see the private key; and a signer container that can see the private key, and responds to simple signing requests from the frontend (for example, over localhost networking).
with this partitioned approach, an attacker now has to trick the application server into doing something rather arbitrary, which may be harder than getting it to read a file.
alternatives to secrets rather than using a secret to protect confidential data, you can pick from alternatives.
here are some of your options: if your cloud-native component needs to authenticate to another application that you know is running within the same kubernetes cluster, you can use a serviceaccount  and its tokens to identify your client.
there are third-party tools that you can run, either within or outside your cluster, that manage sensitive data.
for example, a service that pods access over https, that reveals a secret if the client correctly authenticates (for example, with a serviceaccount token).
for authentication, you can implement a custom signer for x.509 certificates, and use certificatesigningrequests  to let that custom signer issue certificates to pods that need them.
you can use a device plugin  to expose node-local encryption hardware to a specific pod.
for example, you can schedule trusted pods onto nodes that provide a trusted platform module, configured out-of-band.
you can also combine two or more of those options, including the option to use secret objects themselves.
for example: implement (or deploy) an operator  that fetches short-lived session tokens from an external service, and then creates secrets based on those short-lived session tokens.
pods running in your cluster can make use of the session tokens, and operator ensures they are valid.
this separation means that you can run pods that are unaware of the exact mechanisms for issuing and refreshing those session tokens.
======================================== creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.
secret/optional-secret.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      optional: true

by default, secrets are required.
none of a pod's containers will start until all non-optional secrets are available.
if a pod references a specific key in a non-optional secret and that secret does exist, but is missing the named key, the pod fails during startup.
using secrets as files from a pod if you want to access data from a secret in a pod, one way to do that is to have kubernetes make the value of that secret be available as a file inside the filesystem of one or more of the pod's containers.
for instructions, refer to create a pod that has access to the secret data through a volume .
when a volume contains data from a secret, and that secret is updated, kubernetes tracks this and updates the data in the volume, using an eventually-consistent approach.
note: a container using a secret as a subpath  volume mount does not receive automated secret updates.
the kubelet keeps a cache of the curren private registries may require keys to read images from them.
credentials can be provided in several ways: configuring nodes to authenticate to a private registry all pods can read any configured private registries requires node configuration by cluster administrator kubelet credential provider to dynamically fetch credentials for private registries kubelet can be configured to use credential provider exec plugin for the respective private registry.
pre-pulled images all pods can use any images cached on a node requires root access to all nodes to set up specifying imagepullsecrets on a pod only pods which provide their own keys can access the private registry vendor-specific or local extensions if you're using a custom node configuration, you (or your cloud provider) can implement your mechanism for authenticating the node to the container registry.
these options are explained in more detail below.
configuring nodes to authenticate to a private registry specific instructions for setting credentials depends on the container runtime and registry you chose to use.
you should refer to your solution's documentation for the most accurate information.
for an example of configuring a private container image registry, see the pull an image from a private registry  task.
that example uses a private registry in docker hub.
kubelet credential provider for authenticated image pulls note: this approach is especially suitable when kubelet needs to fetch registry credentials dynamically.
most commonly used for registries provided by cloud providers where auth tokens are short-lived.
you can configure the kubelet to invoke a plugin binary to dynamically fetch registry credentials for a container image.
this is the most robust and versatile way to fetch credentials for private registries, but also requires kubelet-level configuration to enable.
see configure a kubelet image credential provider  for more details.
interpretation of config.json the interpretation of

config.json

varies between the original docker implementation and the kubernetes interpretation.
in docker, the auths keys can only specify root urls, whereas kubernetes allows glob urls as well as prefix-matched paths.
the only limitation is that glob patterns (*) have to include the dot (

.

) for each subdomain.
the amount of matched subdomains has to be equal to the amount of glob patterns (

*.

), for example:

*.kubernetes.io

will not match

kubernetes.io

, but

abc.kubernetes.io



*.*.kubernetes.io

will not match

abc.kubernetes.io

, but

abc.def.kubernetes.io



prefix.*.io

will match

prefix.kubernetes.io



*-good.kubernetes.io

will match

prefix-good.kubernetes.io

this means that a

config.json

like this is valid:

{
    ""auths"": {
        ""my-registry.io/images"": { ""auth"": ""…"" },
        ""*.my-registry.io/images"": { ""auth"": ""…"" }
    }
}

image pull operations would now pass the credentials to the cri container runtime for every valid pattern.
for example the following container image names would match successfully:

my-registry.io/images



my-registry.io/images/my-image



my-registry.io/images/another-image



sub.my-registry.io/images/my-image

but not:

a.sub.my-registry.io/images/my-image



a.b.sub.my-registry.io/images/my-image

the kubelet performs image pulls sequentially for every found credential.
this means, that multiple entries in

config.json

for different paths are possible, too:

{
    ""auths"": {
        ""my-registry.io/images"": {
            ""auth"": ""…""
        },
        ""my-registry.io/images/subpath"": {
            ""auth"": ""…""
        }
    }
}

if now a container specifies an image

my-registry.io/images/subpath/my-image

to be pulled, then the kubelet will try to download them from both authentication sources if one of them fails.

Kubernetes allows multiple `imagePullSecrets` to be specified in a pod's configuration. When pulling an image, Kubernetes will attempt to use the secrets in the order they are listed. If the first secret (`deploy-secret`) fails (for example, due to expiration), Kubernetes will automatically try the next one (`permanent-secret`).

In Kubernetes, you can specify multiple `imagePullSecrets` in a Pod's configuration. When the Pod attempts to pull an image, Kubernetes will use the secrets in the order they are listed. If the first secret (`deploy-secret`) fails (for instance, if it has expired), Kubernetes will automatically try the next one (`permanent-secret`).

### Explanation
To allow all network traffic within a specific namespace, you can create the following `NetworkPolicy` resources. For pods in `namespace-a`, this policy permits ingress traffic only from other pods within `namespace-a`, while denying ingress from any other sources. Egress traffic remains unrestricted.

Similarly, for pods in `namespace-b`, the policy allows ingress only from pods in `namespace-b`, again denying ingress from any other sources, with unrestricted egress.

It's important to ensure that you have applied the appropriate labels to your namespaces, such as:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: namespace-a
  labels:
    name: namespace-a
    other: labelname
```

This labeling is crucial to avoid confusion, as the labels used in the `NetworkPolicy` must correspond to the actual labels assigned to your namespaces. The labels can be arbitrary and may include multiple namespaces; for instance, both `namespace-a` and `namespace-c` could share a label like `other: labelname`, allowing you to select multiple namespaces with a single `namespaceSelector` in your `NetworkPolicy`.","see the networkpolicy  reference for a full definition of the resource.

forcing internal cluster traffic to go through a common gateway (this might be best served with a service mesh or other proxy).
anything tls related (use a service mesh or ingress controller for this).
node specific policies (you can use cidr notation for these, but you cannot target nodes by their kubernetes identities specifically).
targeting of services by name (you can, however, target pods or namespaces by their labels , which is often a viable workaround).

advanced policy querying and reachability tooling.
the ability to log network security events (for example connections that are blocked or accepted).
the ability to explicitly deny policies (currently the model for networkpolicies are deny by default, with only the ability to add allow rules).
the ability to prevent loopback or incoming host traffic (pods cannot currently block localhost access, nor do they have the ability to block access from their resident node).
========================================","cni plugins in-use supports network policies.
ingress and egress network policies are applied to all workloads in the cluster.
default network policies within each namespace, selecting all pods, denying everything, are in place.
if appropriate, a service mesh is used to encrypt all communications inside of the cluster.
the kubernetes api, kubelet api and etcd are not exposed publicly on internet.
access from the workloads to the cloud metadata api is filtered.
use of loadbalancer and externalips is restricted.
a number of container network interface (cni) plugins  plugins provide the functionality to restrict network resources that pods may communicate with.
this is most commonly done through network policies  which provide a namespaced resource to define rules.
default network policies blocking everything egress and ingress, in each namespace, selecting all the pods, can be useful to adopt an allow list approach, ensuring that no workloads is missed.
not all cni plugins provide encryption in transit.
if the chosen plugin lacks this feature, an alternative solution could be to use a service mesh to provide that functionality.
the etcd datastore of the control plane should have controls to limit access and not be publicly exposed on the internet.
furthermore, mutual tls (mtls) should be used to communicate securely with it.
the certificate authority for this should be unique to etcd.
external internet access to the kubernetes api server should be restricted to not expose the api publicly.
be careful as many managed kubernetes distribution are publicly exposing the api server by default.
you can then use a bastion host to access the server.
the kubelet  api access should be restricted and not publicly exposed, the defaults authentication and authorization settings, when no configuration file specified with the --config flag, are overly permissive.
if a cloud provider is used for hosting kubernetes, the access from pods to the cloud metadata api

169.254.169.254

should also be restricted or blocked if not needed because it may leak information.

ingress and egress network policies are applied to all workloads in the cluster.
default network policies within each namespace, selecting all pods, denying everything, are in place.
if appropriate, a service mesh is used to encrypt all communications inside of the cluster.
the kubernetes api, kubelet api and etcd are not exposed publicly on internet.
access from the workloads to the cloud metadata api is filtered.
use of loadbalancer and externalips is restricted.
a number of container network interface (cni) plugins  plugins provide the functionality to restrict network resources that pods may communicate with.
this is most commonly done through network policies  which provide a namespaced resource to define rules.
default network policies blocking everything egress and ingress, in each namespace, selecting all the pods, can be useful to adopt an allow list approach, ensuring that no workloads is missed.
not all cni plugins provide encryption in transit.
if the chosen plugin lacks this feature, an alternative solution could be to use a service mesh to provide that functionality.
the etcd datastore of the control plane should have controls to limit access and not be publicly exposed on the internet.
furthermore, mutual tls (mtls) should be used to communicate securely with it.
the certificate authority for this should be unique to etcd.
external internet access to the kubernetes api server should be restricted to not expose the api publicly.
be careful as many managed kubernetes distribution are publicly exposing the api server by default.
you can then use a bastion host to access the server.
the kubelet  api access should be restricted and not publicly exposed, the defaults authentication and authorization settings, when no configuration file specified with the --config flag, are overly permissive.
if a cloud provider is used for hosting kubernetes, the access from pods to the cloud metadata api

169.254.169.254

should also be restricted or blocked if not needed because it may leak information.
for restricted loadbalancer and externalips use, see cve-2020-8554: man in the middle using loadbalancer or externalips  and the denyserviceexternalips admission controller  for further information.

### Explanation
What you have done should work, but ensure that the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) and the StatefulSet are in the same namespace. However, a more efficient approach is to utilize the `volumeClaimTemplates` field within the StatefulSet. This field will automatically create unique PVCs for each replica, with names that end in an ordinal number (e.g., -0, -1, etc.) corresponding to the replicas in the StatefulSet. Therefore, you should use a StatefulSet manifest structured as shown above.","feature state:

kubernetes v1.32 [stable]

(enabled by default: true) the optional

.spec.persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy

field controls if and how pvcs are deleted during the lifecycle of a statefulset.
you must enable the statefulsetautodeletepvc feature gate  on the api server and the controller manager to use this field.
once enabled, there are two policies you can configure for each statefulset: whendeleted configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the statefulset is deleted whenscaled configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the replica count of the statefulset is reduced; for example, when scaling down the set.
for each policy that you can configure, you can set the value to either delete or retain.
delete the pvcs created from the statefulset volumeclaimtemplate are deleted for each pod affected by the policy.
with the whendeleted policy all pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are deleted after their pods have been deleted.
with the whenscaled policy, only pvcs corresponding to pod replicas being scaled down are deleted, after their pods have been deleted.
retain (default) pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are not affected when their pod is deleted.
this is the behavior before this new feature.
bear in mind that these policies only apply when pods are being removed due to the statefulset being deleted or scaled down.
for example, if a pod associated with a statefulset fails due to node failure, and the control plane creates a replacement pod, the statefulset retains the existing pvc.
the existing volume is unaffected, and the cluster will attach it to the node where the new pod is about to launch.
the default for policies is retain, matching the statefulset behavior before this new feature.
here is an example policy.

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: statefulset
...
spec:
  persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy:
    whendeleted: retain
    whenscaled: delete
...

the statefulset controller  adds owner references  to its pvcs, which are then deleted by the garbage collector  after the pod is terminated.
this enables the pod to cleanly unmount all volumes before the pvcs are deleted (and before the backing pv and volume are deleted, depending on the retain policy).
when you set the whendeleted policy to delete, an owner reference to the statefulset instance is placed on all pvcs associated with that statefulset.
the whenscaled policy must delete pvcs only when a pod is scaled down, and not when a pod is deleted for another reason.
when reconciling, the statefulset controller compares its desired replica count to the actual pods present on the cluster.
any statefulset pod whose id greater than the replica count is condemned and marked for deletion.
if the whenscaled policy is delete, the condemned pods are first set as owners to the associated statefulset template pvcs, before the pod is deleted.
this causes the pvcs to be garbage collected after only the condemned pods have terminated.
this means that if the controller crashes and restarts, no pod will be deleted before its owner reference has been updated appropriate to the policy.
if a condemned pod is force-deleted while the controller is down, the owner reference may or may not have been set up, depending on when the controller crashed.
it may take several reconcile loops to update the owner references, so some condemned pods may have set up owner references and others may not.
for this reason we recommend waiting for the controller to come back up, which will verify owner references before terminating pods.
if that is not possible, the operator should verify the owner references on pvcs to ensure the expected objects are deleted when pods are force-deleted.
replicas

.spec.replicas

is an optional field that specifies the number of desired pods.
it defaults to 1.
should you manually scale a deployment, example via

kubectl scale statefulset statefulset --replicas=x

, and then you update that statefulset based on a manifest (for example: by running

kubectl apply -f statefu","each pvc contains a spec and status, which is the specification and status of the claim.

access modes claims use the same conventions as volumes  when requesting storage with specific access modes.
volume modes claims use the same convention as volumes  to indicate the consumption of the volume as either a filesystem or block device.
volume name claims can use the volumename field to explicitly bind to a specific persistentvolume.
you can also leave volumename unset, indicating that you'd like kubernetes to set up a new persistentvolume that matches the claim.
if the specified pv is already bound to another pvc, the binding will be stuck in a pending state.
resources claims, like pods, can request specific quantities of a resource.
in this case, the request is for storage.
the same resource model  applies to both volumes and claims.
selector claims can specify a label selector  to further filter the set of volumes.
only the volumes whose labels match the selector can be bound to the claim.
the selector can consist of two fields: matchlabels - the volume must have a label with this value matchexpressions - a list of requirements made by specifying key, list of values, and operator that relates the key and values.
valid operators include in, notin, exists, and doesnotexist.
all of the requirements, from both matchlabels and matchexpressions, are anded together – they must all be satisfied in order to match.
class a claim can request a particular class by specifying the name of a storageclass  using the attribute storageclassname.
only pvs of the requested class, ones with the same storageclassname as the pvc, can be bound to the pvc.
pvcs don't necessarily have to request a class.
a pvc with its storageclassname set equal to """" is always interpreted to be requesting a pv with no class, so it can only be bound to pvs with no class (no annotation or one set equal to """").
a pvc with no storageclassname is not quite the same and is treated differently by the cluster, depending on whether the defaultstorageclass admission plugin  is turned on.
if the admission plugin is turned on, the administrator may specify a default storageclass.
all pvcs that have no storageclassname can be bound only to pvs of that default.
specifying a default storageclass is done by setting the annotation

storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class

equal to true in a storageclass object.
if the administrator does not specify a default, the cluster responds to pvc creation as if the admission plugin were turned off.
if more than one default storageclass is specified, the newest default is used when the pvc is dynamically provisioned.
if the admission plugin is turned off, there is no notion of a default storageclass.
all pvcs that have storageclassname set to """" can be bound only to pvs that have storageclassname also set to """".
however, pvcs with missing storageclassname can be updated later once default storageclass becomes available.
if the pvc gets updated it will no longer bind to pvs that have storageclassname also set to """".
see retroactive default storageclass assignment  for more details.
depending on installation method, a default storageclass may be deployed to a kubernetes cluster by addon manager during installation.
when a pvc specifies a selector in addition to requesting a storageclass, the requirements are anded together: only a pv of the requested class and with the requested labels may be bound to the pvc.

### Explanation
If the content of the files is static, you can create a `files` directory in your chart at the same level as the `templates` directory (not nested within it) and reference the files accordingly. However, if you need to reference variable values within those files, which allows for content control from `values.yaml`, you might want to consider a different approach. For instance, if you want to expose each value individually, the Helm documentation provides an example using the `range` function. A suitable approach for your case is similar to what the stable/mysql chart does, where a ConfigMap is created that accepts values as strings:

```yaml
{{- if .Values.configurationFiles }}
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ template ""mysql.fullname"" . }}-configuration
data:
{{- range $key, $val := .Values.configurationFiles }}
  {{ $key }}: |-
{{ $val | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
{{- end -}}
```

In this example, the `values.yaml` file allows users to set and override both the files and their content. The commented-out section provides a template for users to customize their MySQL configuration files, while you can also include default values in `values.yaml`. The `tpl` function is only necessary if you require additional flexibility, as seen in the stable/keycloak chart, which allows users to create their own ConfigMap and reference it in the Keycloak deployment. However, for your scenario, the approach used in the MySQL chart is likely the most appropriate. Additionally, the `tpl` function can be utilized to incorporate content from files loaded with `files.get`, effectively integrating that content into the template. For more information, you can refer to the question on loading multiple templated config files into a Helm chart.","say we've defined a simple template that looks like this:{{- define ""mychart.app"" -}}

# Configuration changes for config maps

```

### Explanation
A declarative setup for ArgoCD using Kustomize is an excellent method for configuring custom parameters. This approach aligns with the Kubernetes philosophy of declarative management. The ArgoCD documentation includes a section on additional configuration, detailing the flags available in the `argocd-cmd-params-cm` ConfigMap, such as the `server.insecure` flag, which allows the server to run without TLS.

The ArgoCD server deployment, as provided in the manifest from the official repository, will utilize this parameter if it is defined in the `argocd-cmd-params-cm` ConfigMap. To set up ArgoCD declaratively, the documentation provides guidance on using Kustomize, which the ArgoCD team employs for their own deployments. A live instance can be found at https://cd.apps.argoproj.io/, with the configuration available on GitHub.

To adapt this for our needs, we will transition our ArgoCD installation from using `kubectl apply -f` to a Kustomize-based installation. The documentation outlines the necessary steps, which include creating a directory for the ArgoCD installation and a `kustomization.yaml` file. We enhance the proposed `kustomization.yaml` to include the remote resource and apply customizations through patches.

Next, we create a new file named `argocd-cmd-params-cm-patch.yml`, which contains the specific configuration changes we want to make to the `argocd-cmd-params-cm` ConfigMap. Finally, we install ArgoCD using the Kustomize files with `kubectl apply -k`, ensuring the ArgoCD namespace is created beforehand. This process configures the ArgoCD server deployment to use the `--insecure` flag, allowing Traefik to handle TLS termination, and we can access the ArgoCD dashboard at the expected URL.","official document: by default the controller redirects 308 to https if tls is enabled for that ingress. if you want to disable this behavior globally, you can use ssl-redirect false in the nginx configmap.configmap.md#ssl-redirect. to configure this feature for specific ingress resources, you can use the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iossl-redirect false annotation in the particular resource. when using ssl offloading outside of cluster e.g. aws elb it may be useful to enforce a redirect to https even when there is no tls certificate available. this can be achieved by using the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioforce-ssl-redirect true annotation in the particular resource. to preserve the trailing slash in the uri with ssl-redirect, set nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iopreserve-trailing-slash true annotation for that particular resource.

### Explanation
I have replicated your scenario in a Linux environment (on GCP) and observed that I have different IPs:
```
user@bf:~$ minikube ip
192.168.39.144

user@bf:~$ kubectl get ingresses
name              hosts   address           ports   age
example-ingress   *       192.168.122.173   80      30m
```
Your issue is not related to having different IPs. The guide instructs us to create an Ingress with the following rule:
```yaml
spec:
  rules:
  - host: hello-world.info
```
This rule indicates that a DNS record with the name `hello-world.info` is expected by the Ingress service. If you follow the guide further, it instructs you to create an entry in your hosts file that points to your Ingress IP or Minikube IP.

Note: If you are running Minikube locally, use `minikube ip` to obtain the external IP. The IP address displayed in the Ingress list will be the internal IP. 

Source: Set up Ingress on Minikube with the NGINX Ingress Controller.

(If you prefer to curl the IP instead of using the DNS name, you will need to remove the host rule from your Ingress.)","learn more about ingress .

### Explanation
I discovered the method to utilize the gp3 volume type in a storage class on Amazon EKS. First, you need to install the Amazon EBS CSI driver by following the official instructions provided. After the installation of the Amazon EBS CSI driver, you can create the storage class named `ebs-sc` as shown above.

To verify that you can use the gp3 volume type in your storage class on EKS, you can deploy the following resources:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-gp3-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: ebs-sc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-gp3-in-tree
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:

      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
  - name: persistent-storage
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: ebs-gp3-claim
```

For detailed documentation on migrating Amazon EKS clusters from gp2 to gp3 EBS volumes, you can refer to this link: [Migrating Amazon EKS Clusters from gp2 to gp3 EBS Volumes](https://aws.amazon.com/vi/blogs/containers/migrating-amazon-eks-clusters-from-gp2-to-gp3-ebs-volumes/). Additionally, you may find references regarding persistent storage in EKS and issues related to volume provisioning helpful.","the pvc requests storage from the storageclass.

access modes claims use the same conventions as volumes  when requesting storage with specific access modes.
volume modes claims use the same convention as volumes  to indicate the consumption of the volume as either a filesystem or block device.
volume name claims can use the volumename field to explicitly bind to a specific persistentvolume.
you can also leave volumename unset, indicating that you'd like kubernetes to set up a new persistentvolume that matches the claim.
if the specified pv is already bound to another pvc, the binding will be stuck in a pending state.
resources claims, like pods, can request specific quantities of a resource.
in this case, the request is for storage.
the same resource model  applies to both volumes and claims.
selector claims can specify a label selector  to further filter the set of volumes.
only the volumes whose labels match the selector can be bound to the claim.
the selector can consist of two fields: matchlabels - the volume must have a label with this value matchexpressions - a list of requirements made by specifying key, list of values, and operator that relates the key and values.
valid operators include in, notin, exists, and doesnotexist.
all of the requirements, from both matchlabels and matchexpressions, are anded together – they must all be satisfied in order to match.
class a claim can request a particular class by specifying the name of a storageclass  using the attribute storageclassname.
only pvs of the requested class, ones with the same storageclassname as the pvc, can be bound to the pvc.
pvcs don't necessarily have to request a class.
a pvc with its storageclassname set equal to """" is always interpreted to be requesting a pv with no class, so it can only be bound to pvs with no class (no annotation or one set equal to """").
a pvc with no storageclassname is not quite the same and is treated differently by the cluster, depending on whether the defaultstorageclass admission plugin  is turned on.
if the admission plugin is turned on, the administrator may specify a default storageclass.
all pvcs that have no storageclassname can be bound only to pvs of that default.
specifying a default storageclass is done by setting the annotation

storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class

equal to true in a storageclass object.
if the administrator does not specify a default, the cluster responds to pvc creation as if the admission plugin were turned off.
if more than one default storageclass is specified, the newest default is used when the pvc is dynamically provisioned.
if the admission plugin is turned off, there is no notion of a default storageclass.
all pvcs that have storageclassname set to """" can be bound only to pvs that have storageclassname also set to """".
however, pvcs with missing storageclassname can be updated later once default storageclass becomes available.
if the pvc gets updated it will no longer bind to pvs that have storageclassname also set to """".
see retroactive default storageclass assignment  for more details.
depending on installation method, a default storageclass may be deployed to a kubernetes cluster by addon manager during installation.
when a pvc specifies a selector in addition to requesting a storageclass, the requirements are anded together: only a pv of the requested class and with the requested labels may be bound to the pvc.

access modes claims use the same conventions as volumes  when requesting storage with specific access modes.
volume modes claims use the same convention as volumes  to indicate the consumption of the volume as either a filesystem or block device.
volume name claims can use the volumename field to explicitly bind to a specific persistentvolume.
you can also leave volumename unset, indicating that you'd like kubernetes to set up a new persistentvolume that matches the claim.
if the specified pv is already bound to another pvc, the binding will be stuck in a pending state.
resources claims, like pods, can request specific quantities of a resource.
in this case, the request is for storage.
the same resource model  applies to both volumes and claims.
selector claims can specify a label selector  to further filter the set of volumes.
only the volumes whose labels match the selector can be bound to the claim.
the selector can consist of two fields: matchlabels - the volume must have a label with this value matchexpressions - a list of requirements made by specifying key, list of values, and operator that relates the key and values.
valid operators include in, notin, exists, and doesnotexist.
all of the requirements, from both matchlabels and matchexpressions, are anded together – they must all be satisfied in order to match.
class a claim can request a particular class by specifying the name of a storageclass  using the attribute storageclassname.
only pvs of the requested class, ones with the same storageclassname as the pvc, can be bound to the pvc.
pvcs don't necessarily have to request a class.
a pvc with its storageclassname set equal to """" is always interpreted to be requesting a pv with no class, so it can only be bound to pvs with no class (no annotation or one set equal to """").
a pvc with no storageclassname is not quite the same and is treated differently by the cluster, depending on whether the defaultstorageclass admission plugin  is turned on.
if the admission plugin is turned on, the administrator may specify a default storageclass.
all pvcs that have no storageclassname can be bound only to pvs of that default.
specifying a default storageclass is done by setting the annotation

storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class

equal to true in a storageclass object.
if the administrator does not specify a default, the cluster responds to pvc creation as if the admission plugin were turned off.
if more than one default storageclass is specified, the newest default is used when the pvc is dynamically provisioned.
if the admission plugin is turned off, there is no notion of a default storageclass.
all pvcs that have storageclassname set to """" can be bound only to pvs that have storageclassname also set to """".
however, pvcs with missing storageclassname can be updated later once default storageclass becomes available.
if the pvc gets updated it will no longer bind to pvs that have storageclassname also set to """".
see retroactive default storageclass assignment  for more details.
depending on installation method, a default storageclass may be deployed to a kubernetes cluster by addon manager during installation.
when a pvc specifies a selector in addition to requesting a storageclass, the requirements are anded together: only a pv of the requested class and with the requested labels may be bound to the pvc.
note: currently, a pvc with a non-empty selector can't have a pv dynamically provisioned for it.

The issue arises because the AWS EBS volume type ""gp3"" is not recognized in the context of the StorageClass configuration. Changing the volume type to ""gp2"" resolves the provisioning failure.

### Explanation
You can customize the configuration for your NGINX Ingress Controller, and the relevant documentation is available for reference. If your goal is to use the NGINX Ingress Controller solely as a reverse proxy, each ingress rule automatically generates a `proxy_pass` directive to the corresponding upstream or backend service.

If the paths in your ingress rule match those of your backend service, you do not need to specify a rewrite rule; simply defining the path for the backend service is sufficient. However, if the paths differ, you should consider using the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation to avoid encountering a 404 backend error.

For instance, to redirect requests coming to the frontend at `http://example.com/something` to the backend service at `example-com/something`, your ingress rule should resemble the example provided above.

For further details on annotations, please refer to the NGINX Ingress annotations documentation. Additionally, if you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the NGINX Ingress Controller pod using the command:

```bash
kubectl logs nginx-ingress-controller-xxxxx
```

### Explanation
Ingress controllers are primarily designed for handling HTTP connections. As indicated by the error message, using ingress to access MongoDB is not appropriate. The parameters defined in an ingress resource, such as hostnames and HTTP URL paths, do not apply to plain TCP connections. 

Some ingress controllers, like nginx-ingress, can manage plain TCP load balancing, but this is not done through an ingress definition; instead, it requires custom configuration maps. 

If your hosting environment allows it, you should use a service of type `LoadBalancer`. If not, you can opt for a service of type `NodePort`. An example of this can be found in the stable MongoDB Helm chart along with its associated values.","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

### Explanation
There are several strategies to tackle this issue. The current setup, which involves having a separate file for each resource while maintaining some logical duplication, is a fairly common approach. It clearly delineates the resources being created and minimizes complexity. The Go templating language can be somewhat specialized, making this method more accessible for others involved in your project.

If you prefer to consolidate resources, there are a few alternatives. As noted by @matt in their comment, you can include multiple Kubernetes resources within a single file, provided they are separated by the YAML document separator (`---`). 

The key requirement is that the output of the template must form a valid multi-document YAML file. You can utilize the `helm template` command to preview the output without deploying it to the cluster. This method works well with a list of configuration rules defined in your YAML file, such as:

```yaml
ingresses:
  - name: apps-ingress
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: hybrid-external
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""http""
  - name: apps-ingress-private
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: hybrid-internal
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""http""
```

You can leverage the Go template `range` construct to iterate over these entries. Note that this utilizes the `.` special variable, so if you need to reference other elements in `.Values`, you should store the current value first:

```yaml
{{- $top := . -}}
{{- range $ingress := .Values.ingresses -}}
---
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: {{ $ingress.name }}
  annotations: {{- $ingress.annotations | toYaml | nindent 4 }}
...
{{ end }}

### Explanation:
This template combines both public and private Ingress configurations into a single template. The private Ingress is conditionally included based on the `enabled` flag in the `values.yaml` file. This allows for optional private configurations while managing multiple resources effectively. Adjust your `values.yaml` to include a section for `ingress.private` similar to the public ingress.","```yaml

### Explanation:
This revised template adheres to the latest Kubernetes API standards by using `networking.k8s.io/v1` for the Ingress resource. It maintains the structure of the original response while ensuring that the terminology and field names are consistent with the Kubernetes API. The `pathType` field is explicitly set to `Prefix`, which is a recommended practice for defining how paths are matched. The use of `toYaml` for annotations ensures proper formatting. The template also retains the conditional inclusion of both public and private Ingress configurations based on the `enabled` flags in the `values.yaml` file.","3602.0, 2703.0, 3397.0"

I encountered a similar issue while testing with Helm when attempting to switch the service type from NodePort/ClusterIP to LoadBalancer. Here’s how I replicated the problem:

1. I used Kubernetes version 1.15.3 on GKE and Helm version 3.1.1 with the stable/nginx-ingress chart.
2. After fetching and extracting the Helm chart, I modified the service type in the `values.yaml` file from `LoadBalancer` to `NodePort`.
3. Upon installing the chart, I confirmed that the service type was indeed set to `NodePort`.
4. I then changed the service type back to `LoadBalancer` in the `values.yaml` file and attempted to upgrade the chart using the `--force` flag.

This resulted in an error indicating that the service was invalid due to an immutable field (`spec.clusterIP`). 

Upon reviewing the Helm source code, I found that when the `--force` flag is used, Helm attempts to replace the existing resource rather than patching it. This behavior is similar to the `kubectl replace` command, which does not allow changes to immutable fields like `spec.clusterIP`. In contrast, using `kubectl patch` allows for changing the service type without encountering this issue.

To work around this, I recommend using `helm upgrade` without the `--force` flag. If you must use `--force`, manually update the service specifications before the upgrade. Alternatively, you can export the service YAML, modify the type, and apply it again, which allows for a successful replacement. 

This approach ensures that subsequent `helm upgrade --force` commands will work without issues, as long as there are no changes to the service itself. I hope this information is helpful!","you should audit the charts that you use (similar to
 chart
maintainers ) and identify any charts where api versions are
deprecated or removed in a kubernetes version. for the charts identified, you
need to check for the latest version of the chart (which has supported api
versions) or update the chart yourself.additionally, you also need to audit any charts deployed (i.e. helm releases)
checking again for any deprecated or removed api versions. this can be done by
getting details of a release using the  helm get manifest  command.the means for updating a helm release to supported apis depends on your findings
as follows:if you find deprecated api versions only then:perform a  helm upgrade  with a version of the chart with supported
kubernetes api versions add a description in the upgrade, something along the lines to not perform a
rollback to a helm version prior to this current versionif you find any api version(s) that is/are removed in a kubernetes version
then:if you are running a kubernetes version where the api version(s) are still
available (for example, you are on kubernetes 1.15 and found you use apis
that will be removed in kubernetes 1.16): follow the step 1 procedure otherwise (for example, you are already running a kubernetes version where
some api versions reported by  helm get manifest  are no longer available): you need to edit the release manifest that is stored in the cluster to
update the api versions to supported apis. see
 updating api versions of a
release manifest  for more
detailsnote: in all cases of updating a helm release with supported apis, you should
never rollback the release to a version prior to the release version with the
supported apis.recommendation: the best practice is to upgrade releases using deprecated api
versions to supported api versions, prior to upgrading to a kubernetes cluster
that removes those api versions.if you don't update a release as suggested previously, you will have an error
similar to the following when trying to upgrade a release in a kubernetes
version where its api version(s) is/are removed:error: upgrade failed: current release manifest contains removed kubernetes api(s)
 for this kubernetes version and it is therefore unable to build the kubernetes
 objects for performing the diff. error from kubernetes: unable to recognize """":
 no matches for kind ""deployment"" in version ""apps/v1beta1""helm fails in this scenario because it attempts to create a diff patch between
the current deployed release (which contains the kubernetes apis that are
removed in this kubernetes version) against the chart you are passing with the
updated/supported api versions. the underlying reason for failure is that when
kubernetes removes an api version, the kubernetes go client library can no
longer parse the deprecated objects and helm therefore fails when calling the
library. helm unfortunately is unable to recover from this situation and is no
longer able to manage such a release. see
 updating api versions of a release

to recover from this scenario.","i am getting a warning about ""unable to get an update from the ""stable"" chart repository""run  helm repo list . if it shows your  stable  repository pointing to a  storage.googleapis.com  url, you

executes.this is caused by macos's mdns library. it attempts to load that file to read
debugging settings (if enabled). the file handle probably should not be held open, and
this issue has been reported to apple. however, it is macos, not helm, that causes this
behavior.if you do not want helm to load this file, you may be able to compile helm to as
a static library that does not use the host network stack. doing so will inflate the
binary size of helm, but will prevent the file from being open.this issue was originally flagged as a potential security problem. but it has since
been determined that there is no flaw or vulnerability caused by this behavior.helm repo add fails when it used to workin helm 3.3.1 and before, the command  helm repo add <reponame> <url>  will give

important role for teams working on a shared cluster - it made it possible for
multiple different operators to interact with the same set of releases.with role-based access controls (rbac) enabled by default in kubernetes 1.6,
locking down tiller for use in a production scenario became more difficult to
manage. due to the vast number of possible security policies, our stance was to
provide a permissive default configuration. this allowed first-time users to
start experimenting with helm and kubernetes without having to dive headfirst
into the security controls. unfortunately, this permissive configuration could
grant a user a broad range of permissions they weren’t intended to have. devops
and sres had to learn additional operational steps when installing tiller into a
multi-tenant cluster.after hearing how community members were using helm in certain scenarios, we
found that tiller’s release management system did not need to rely upon an
in-cluster operator to maintain state or act as a central hub for helm release
information. instead, we could simply fetch information from the kubernetes api
server, render the charts client-side, and store a record of the installation in
kubernetes.tiller’s primary goal could be accomplished without tiller, so one of the first
decisions we made regarding helm 3 was to completely remove tiller.with tiller gone, the security model for helm is radically simplified. helm 3
now supports all the modern security, identity, and authorization features of
modern kubernetes. helm’s permissions are evaluated using your
 kubeconfig
file .
cluster administrators can restrict user permissions at whatever granularity
they see fit. releases are still recorded in-cluster, and the rest of helm’s
functionality remains.improved upgrade strategy: 3-way strategic merge patcheshelm 2 used a two-way strategic merge patch. during an upgrade, it compared the
most recent chart's manifest against the proposed chart's manifest (the one
supplied during  helm upgrade ). it compared the differences between these two
charts to determine what changes needed to be applied to the resources in
kubernetes. if changes were applied to the cluster out-of-band (such as during a
 kubectl edit ), those changes were not considered. this resulted in resources
being unable to roll back to its previous state: because helm only considered
the last applied chart's manifest as its current state, if there were no changes
in the chart's state, the live state was left unchanged.in helm 3, we now use a three-way strategic merge patch. helm considers the old
manifest, its live state, and the new manifest when generating a patch.exampleslet's go through a few common examples what this change impacts.rolling back where live state has changedyour team just deployed their application to production on kubernetes using

### Explanation
I encountered a similar issue with my configuration and discovered that the name specified under users is not the username used for login; rather, it serves as an identifier for the user section in the configuration. In your scenario, only the certificate key is utilized to authenticate the user. Therefore, you can define your users as follows:

```yaml
users:
- name: kubernetes-admin-1
  user:
    client-certificate-data: aabbcc
    client-key-data: aabbcc
- name: kubernetes-admin-2
  user:
    client-certificate-data: xxyyyzzz
    client-key-data: xxxyyyzzz
```

You can then reference this in the context simply by the key:

```yaml
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: dev-cluster
    user: kubernetes-admin-1
```

For authentication methods that require a username, you would configure it like this:

```yaml
users:
- name: kubernetes-admin-with-password
  user:
    username: kubernetes-admin
    password: mysecretpass
```

Using multiple kubeconfig files can be cumbersome, as you need to specify them for each command. However, you can include as many contexts and users as needed in a single configuration file and select the appropriate context (which can also be saved as the default).","suppose you have several clusters, and your users and components authenticate in a variety of ways.
for example: a running kubelet might authenticate using certificates.
a user might authenticate using tokens.
administrators might have sets of certificates that they provide to individual users.
with kubeconfig files, you can organize your clusters, users, and namespaces.
you can also define contexts to quickly and easily switch between clusters and namespaces.
========================================","suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for test work.
in the development cluster, your frontend developers work in a namespace called frontend, and your storage developers work in a namespace called storage.
in your test cluster, developers work in the default namespace, or they create auxiliary namespaces as they see fit.
access to the development cluster requires authentication by certificate.
access to the test cluster requires authentication by username and password.
create a directory named config-exercise.
in your config-exercise directory, create a file named config-demo with this content:

apiversion: v1
kind: config
preferences: {}

clusters:
- cluster:
  name: development
- cluster:
  name: test

users:
- name: developer
- name: experimenter

contexts:
- context:
  name: dev-frontend
- context:
  name: dev-storage
- context:
  name: exp-test

a configuration file describes clusters, users, and contexts.
your config-demo file has the framework to describe two clusters, two users, and three contexts.
go to your config-exercise directory.
enter these commands to add cluster details to your configuration file:

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster development --server=https://1.2.3.4 --certificate-authority=fake-ca-file
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster test --server=https://5.6.7.8 --insecure-skip-tls-verify

add user details to your configuration file: caution: storing passwords in kubernetes client config is risky.
a better alternative would be to use a credential plugin and store them separately.
see: client-go credential plugins 

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials developer --client-certificate=fake-cert-file --client-key=fake-key-seefile
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials experimenter --username=exp --password=some-password

note: to delete a user you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset users.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a cluster, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset clusters.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a context, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset contexts.&lt;name&gt;

add context details to your configuration file:

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-frontend --cluster=development --namespace=frontend --user=developer

========================================","suppose you have several clusters, and your users and components authenticate in a variety of ways.
for example: a running kubelet might authenticate using certificates.
a user might authenticate using tokens.
administrators might have sets of certificates that they provide to individual users.
with kubeconfig files, you can organize your clusters, users, and namespaces.
you can also define contexts to quickly and easily switch between clusters and namespaces.
======================================== suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for test work.
in the development cluster, your frontend developers work in a namespace called frontend, and your storage developers work in a namespace called storage.
in your test cluster, developers work in the default namespace, or they create auxiliary namespaces as they see fit.
access to the development cluster requires authentication by certificate.
access to the test cluster requires authentication by username and password.

To resolve the issue of having the same user name across different clusters, I have modified the user names to be unique by appending the cluster name (e.g., `kubernetes-admin-team` and `kubernetes-admin-dev`). This allows you to clearly identify which user belongs to which cluster in your contexts.","```yaml

To address the issue of having the same user name across different clusters, I have ensured that the user names are unique by appending the cluster name (e.g., `kubernetes-admin-team` for the `team-cluster` and `kubernetes-admin-dev` for the `dev-cluster`). This differentiation allows for clear identification of users associated with each cluster in your contexts. This approach aligns with best practices for managing Kubernetes configurations, ensuring that user contexts are distinct and easily manageable.","505.0, 1612.0, 2476.0"

```

### Explanation
Helm provides a `tpl` function that allows you to evaluate a string as a Go template. In your scenario, the output of `...AsConfig` is a string that can be processed by the template engine. By using this approach, you can incorporate arbitrary template logic directly within your configuration file. For instance, it's quite common to define a template that generates the name prefix for the current chart. Consequently, your configuration file could be structured as follows:

```yaml
foo:
  service:
    name: {{ template ""mychart.name"" . }}-service
```","say we've defined a simple template that looks like this:{{- define ""mychart.app"" -}} 
 app_name :   {{   .chart.name }} 
 app_version :   ""{{ .chart.version }}"" 
 {{- end -}}now say i want to insert this both into the  labels:  section of my template,
and also the  data:  section:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
    labels : 
      {{   template ""mychart.app"" . }} 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- range $key, $val := .values.favorite }} 
    {{   $key }} :   {{   $val | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
 {{   template ""mychart.app"" . }}if we render this, we will get an error like this:$  helm install --dry-run measly-whippet ./mychart
 error: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: error validating """": error validating data: [validationerror(configmap): unknown field ""app_name"" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.configmap, validationerror(configmap): unknown field ""app_version"" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.configmap]to see what rendered, re-run with  --disable-openapi-validation :
 helm install --dry-run --disable-openapi-validation measly-whippet ./mychart .
the output will not be what we expect:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml 
 apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   measly-whippet-configmap 
    labels : 
      app_name :   mychart 
 app_version :   ""0.1.0"" 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    drink :   ""coffee"" 
    food :   ""pizza"" 
 app_name :   mychart 
 app_version :   ""0.1.0""note that the indentation on  app_version  is wrong in both places. why? because
the template that is substituted in has the text aligned to the left. because
 template  is an action, and not a function, there is no way to pass the output
of a  template  call to other functions; the data is simply inserted inline.to work around this case, helm provides an alternative to  template  that will
import the contents of a template into the present pipeline where it can be
passed along to other functions in the pipeline.here's the example above, corrected to use  indent  to indent the  mychart.app 
template correctly:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
    labels : 
 {{   include ""mychart.app"" . | indent 4 }} 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- range $key, $val := .values.favorite }} 
    {{   $key }} :   {{   $val | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
 {{   include ""mychart.app"" . | indent 2 }}now the produced yaml is correctly indented for each section:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml 
 apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   edgy-mole-configmap 
    labels : 
      app_name :   mychart 
      app_version :   ""0.1.0"" 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    drink :   ""coffee"" 
    food :   ""pizza"" 
    app_name :   mychart 
    app_version :   ""0.1.0""it is considered preferable to use  include  over  template  in helm templates
simply so that the output formatting can be handled better for yaml documents.sometimes we want to import content, but not as templates. that is, we want to
import files verbatim. we can achieve this by accessing files through the
 .files  object described in the next section.prev ← variables next accessing files inside templates →","the first template we are going to create will be a  configmap . in kubernetes,
a configmap is simply an object for storing configuration data. other things,
like pods, can access the data in a configmap.because configmaps are basic resources, they make a great starting point for us.let's begin by creating a file called  mychart/templates/configmap.yaml :apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   mychart-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world""tip:  template names do not follow a rigid naming pattern. however, we
recommend using the extension  .yaml  for yaml files and  .tpl  for helpers.the yaml file above is a bare-bones configmap, having the minimal necessary
fields. by virtue of the fact that this file is in the  mychart/templates/ 
directory, it will be sent through the template engine.it is just fine to put a plain yaml file like this in the  mychart/templates/ 
directory. when helm reads this template, it will simply send it to kubernetes
as-is.with this simple template, we now have an installable chart. and we can install
it like this:$  helm install full-coral ./mychart
 name: full-coral
 last deployed: tue nov  1 17:36:01 2016
 namespace: default
 status: deployed
 revision: 1
 test suite: noneusing helm, we can retrieve the release and see the actual template that was
loaded.$  helm get manifest full-coral

 #  source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml
 apiversion: v1
 kind: configmap
 metadata:
   name: mychart-configmap
 data:
   myvalue: ""hello world""the  helm get manifest  command takes a release name ( full-coral ) and prints
out all of the kubernetes resources that were uploaded to the server. each file
begins with  ---  to indicate the start of a yaml document, and then is followed
by an automatically generated comment line that tells us what template file
generated this yaml document.from there on, we can see that the yaml data is exactly what we put in our
 configmap.yaml  file.now we can uninstall our release:  helm uninstall full-coral .adding a simple template callhard-coding the  name:  into a resource is usually considered to be bad
practice. names should be unique to a release. so we might want to generate a
name field by inserting the release name.tip:  the  name:  field is limited to 63 characters because of limitations to
the dns system. for that reason, release names are limited to 53 characters.
kubernetes 1.3 and earlier limited to only 24 characters (thus 14 character
names).let's alter  configmap.yaml  accordingly.apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world""the big change comes in the value of the  name:  field, which is now
 {{ .release.name }}-configmap .a template directive is enclosed in  {{  and  }}  blocks.the template directive  {{ .release.name }}  injects the release name into the
template. the values that are passed into a template can be thought of as
 namespaced objects , where a dot ( . ) separates each namespaced element.the leading dot before  release  indicates that we start with the top-most
namespace for this scope (we'll talk about scope in a bit). so we could read
 .release.name  as ""start at the top namespace, find the  release  object, then
look inside of it for an object called  name "".the  release  object is one of the built-in objects for helm, and we'll cover it
in more depth later. but for now, it is sufficient to say that this will display
the release name that the library assigns to our release.now when we install our resource, we'll immediately see the result of using this
template directive:$  helm install clunky-serval ./mychart

instead of  mychart-configmap  previously.at this point, we've","the  define  action allows us to create a named template inside of a template
file. its syntax goes like this:{{- define ""my.name"" }} 
    # body of template here 
 {{- end }}for example, we can define a template to encapsulate a kubernetes block of
labels:{{- define ""mychart.labels"" }} 
    labels : 
      generator :   helm 
      date :   {{   now | htmldate }} 
 {{- end }}now we can embed this template inside of our existing configmap, and then
include it with the  template  action:{{- define ""mychart.labels"" }}

      date :   {{   now | htmldate }}

    {{- range $key, $val := .values.favorite }} 
    {{   $key }} :   {{   $val | quote }} 
    {{- end }}when the template engine reads this file, it will store away the reference to
 mychart.labels  until  template ""mychart.labels""  is called. then it will

    labels : 
      generator :   helm

templates are declared with the same name the last occurrence will be the one
that is used. since templates in subcharts are compiled together with top-level
templates, it is best to name your templates with  chart specific names . a
popular naming convention is to prefix each defined template with the name of
the chart:  {{ define ""mychart.labels"" }} .","say we've defined a simple template that looks like this:{{- define ""mychart.app"" -}} 
 app_name :   {{   .chart.name }} 
 app_version :   ""{{ .chart.version }}"" 
 {{- end -}}now say i want to insert this both into the  labels:  section of my template,
and also the  data:  section:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
    labels : 
      {{   template ""mychart.app"" . }} 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- range $key, $val := .values.favorite }} 
    {{   $key }} :   {{   $val | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
 {{   template ""mychart.app"" . }}if we render this, we will get an error like this:$  helm install --dry-run measly-whippet ./mychart
 error: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: error validating """": error validating data: [validationerror(configmap): unknown field ""app_name"" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.configmap, validationerror(configmap): unknown field ""app_version"" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.configmap]to see what rendered, re-run with  --disable-openapi-validation :

    food :   ""pizza"" 
 app_name :   mychart 
 app_version :   ""0.1.0""note that the indentation on  app_version  is wrong in both places. why? because
the template that is substituted in has the text aligned to the left. because
 template  is an action, and not a function, there is no way to pass the output
of a  template  call to other functions; the data is simply inserted inline.to work around this case, helm provides an alternative to  template  that will
import the contents of a template into the present pipeline where it can be
passed along to other functions in the pipeline.here's the example above, corrected to use  indent  to indent the  mychart.app 
template correctly:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
    labels :

    {{- range $key, $val := .values.favorite }} 
    {{   $key }} :   {{   $val | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
 {{   include ""mychart.app"" . | indent 2 }}now the produced yaml is correctly indented for each section:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml

    drink :   ""coffee"" 
    food :   ""pizza"" 
    app_name :   mychart 
    app_version :   ""0.1.0""it is considered preferable to use  include  over  template  in helm templates
simply so that the output formatting can be handled better for yaml documents.sometimes we want to import content, but not as templates. that is, we want to
import files verbatim. we can achieve this by accessing files through the
 .files  object described in the next section.prev ← variables next accessing files inside templates → the first template we are going to create will be a  configmap . in kubernetes,
a configmap is simply an object for storing configuration data. other things,
like pods, can access the data in a configmap.because configmaps are basic resources, they make a great starting point for us.let's begin by creating a file called  mychart/templates/configmap.yaml :apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   mychart-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world""tip:  template names do not follow a rigid naming pattern. however, we
recommend using the extension  .yaml  for yaml files and  .tpl  for helpers.the yaml file above is a bare-bones configmap, having the minimal necessary
fields. by virtue of the fact that this file is in the  mychart/templates/ 
directory, it will be sent through the template engine.it is just fine to put a plain yaml file like this in the  mychart/templates/ 
directory. when helm reads this template, it will simply send it to kubernetes
as-is.with this simple template, we now have an installable chart. and we can install
it like this:$  helm install full-coral ./mychart
 name: full-coral
 last deployed: tue nov  1 17:36:01 2016

 #  source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml
 apiversion: v1

 metadata:
   name: mychart-configmap
 data:
   myvalue: ""hello world""the  helm get manifest  command takes a release name ( full-coral ) and prints
out all of the kubernetes resources that were uploaded to the server. each file
begins with  ---  to indicate the start of a yaml document, and then is followed
by an automatically generated comment line that tells us what template file
generated this yaml document.from there on, we can see that the yaml data is exactly what we put in our
 configmap.yaml  file.now we can uninstall our release:  helm uninstall full-coral .adding a simple template callhard-coding the  name:  into a resource is usually considered to be bad
practice. names should be unique to a release. so we might want to generate a
name field by inserting the release name.tip:  the  name:  field is limited to 63 characters because of limitations to
the dns system. for that reason, release names are limited to 53 characters.
kubernetes 1.3 and earlier limited to only 24 characters (thus 14 character
names).let's alter  configmap.yaml  accordingly.apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world""the big change comes in the value of the  name:  field, which is now
 {{ .release.name }}-configmap .a template directive is enclosed in  {{  and  }}  blocks.the template directive  {{ .release.name }}  injects the release name into the
template. the values that are passed into a template can be thought of as
 namespaced objects , where a dot ( . ) separates each namespaced element.the leading dot before  release  indicates that we start with the top-most
namespace for this scope (we'll talk about scope in a bit). so we could read
 .release.name  as ""start at the top namespace, find the  release  object, then
look inside of it for an object called  name "".the  release  object is one of the built-in objects for helm, and we'll cover it
in more depth later. but for now, it is sufficient to say that this will display
the release name that the library assigns to our release.now when we install our resource, we'll immediately see the result of using this
template directive:$  helm install clunky-serval ./mychart

file. its syntax goes like this:{{- define ""my.name"" }}

labels:{{- define ""mychart.labels"" }} 
    labels :

    {{- end }}when the template engine reads this file, it will store away the reference to
 mychart.labels  until  template ""mychart.labels""  is called. then it will

### Explanation
The concept of access modes can be somewhat misleading, particularly when it comes to NFS. In the Kubernetes Persistent Volume documentation, it states that NFS supports all types of access modes: ReadWriteOnce (RWO), ReadOnlyMany (ROX), and ReadWriteMany (RWX). However, access modes should be viewed as matching criteria, similar to storage size, and this is explained more clearly in the OpenShift access mode documentation.

A PersistentVolume (PV) can be mounted in various ways depending on the capabilities of the resource provider. Each provider has different capabilities, and the access modes for each PV are determined by the specific modes supported by that volume. For instance, while NFS can support multiple read-write clients, a specific NFS PV might be exported as read-only on the server. Each PV has its own set of access modes that describe its capabilities.

When a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is created, it is matched to volumes with similar access modes. The only criteria for matching are access modes and size. A claim's access modes represent a request, meaning you may be granted more access than requested, but never less. For example, if a claim requests RWO but the only available volume is an NFS PV that supports RWO, ROX, and RWX, the claim will match the NFS PV because it meets the RWO requirement.

Direct matches are prioritized first. The volume's access modes must match or include more modes than requested, and the size must be equal to or greater than what is specified. If two types of volumes, such as NFS and iSCSI, have the same access modes, either can fulfill a claim with those modes. There is no preference between volume types, and no way to select one type over another.

All volumes with the same access modes are grouped and sorted by size, from smallest to largest. The binder selects the group with matching modes and iterates through them in size order until it finds a suitable match.

Access modes are descriptors of a volume's capabilities rather than enforced constraints. The storage provider is responsible for any runtime errors that arise from improper use of the resource.

For example, NFS offers the ReadWriteOnce access mode, but if you want to utilize the ROX capability, you must specify the claims as read-only. Errors from the provider will manifest at runtime as mount errors.

Another example illustrates that you can specify multiple access modes since they serve as matching criteria rather than constraints:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: example-pvc-rwo-rom
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadOnlyMany
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

When you check the status of the PVCs, you may find that one PVC is in a pending state because the default GKE gcePersistentDisk does not support ReadWriteMany. In contrast, the second PVC, `example-pvc-rwo-rom`, is successfully created and shows two access modes: RWO and ROX. In summary, access modes are more like requirements for PVC/PV binding. If an NFS volume that supports all access modes binds with RWO, it fulfills the requirement while still functioning as RWM due to its capabilities. I hope this clarifies the concept for you. Additionally, you may want to explore other discussions on Stack Overflow regarding access modes.","each pv contains a spec and status, which is the specification and status of the volume.

volume mode feature state:

kubernetes v1.18 [stable]

kubernetes supports two volumemodes of persistentvolumes: filesystem and block.
volumemode is an optional api parameter.
filesystem is the default mode used when volumemode parameter is omitted.
a volume with volumemode: filesystem is mounted into pods into a directory.
if the volume is backed by a block device and the device is empty, kubernetes creates a filesystem on the device before mounting it for the first time.
you can set the value of volumemode to block to use a volume as a raw block device.
such volume is presented into a pod as a block device, without any filesystem on it.
this mode is useful to provide a pod the fastest possible way to access a volume, without any filesystem layer between the pod and the volume.
on the other hand, the application running in the pod must know how to handle a raw block device.
see raw block volume support  for an example on how to use a volume with volumemode: block in a pod.
access modes a persistentvolume can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the resource provider.
as shown in the table below, providers will have different capabilities and each pv's access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume.
for example, nfs can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific nfs pv might be exported on the server as read-only.
each pv gets its own set of access modes describing that specific pv's capabilities.
the access modes are: readwriteonce the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
readwriteonce access mode still can allow multiple pods to access (read from or write to) that volume when the pods are running on the same node.
for single pod access, please see readwriteoncepod.
readonlymany the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
readwritemany the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.
readwriteoncepod feature state:

kubernetes v1.29 [stable]

the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single pod.
use readwriteoncepod access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across the whole cluster can read that pvc or write to it.
note: the readwriteoncepod access mode is only supported for csi  volumes and kubernetes version 1.22+.
to use this feature you will need to update the following csi sidecars  to these versions or greater: csi-provisioner:v3.0.0+  csi-attacher:v3.3.0+  csi-resizer:v1.3.0+  in the cli, the access modes are abbreviated to: rwo - readwriteonce rox - readonlymany rwx - readwritemany rwop - readwriteoncepod note: kubernetes uses volume access modes to match persistentvolumeclaims and persistentvolumes.
in some cases, the volume access modes also constrain where the persistentvolume can be mounted.
volume access modes do not enforce write protection once the storage has been mounted.
even if the access modes are specified as readwriteonce, readonlymany, or readwritemany, they don't set any constraints on the volume.
for example, even if a persistentvolume is create","the next step is to create a persistentvolumeclaim.
pods use persistentvolumeclaims to request physical storage.
in this exercise, you create a persistentvolumeclaim that requests a volume of at least three gibibytes that can provide read-write access for at most one node at a time.
here is the configuration file for the persistentvolumeclaim: pods/storage/pv-claim.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: persistentvolumeclaim
metadata:
  name: task-pv-claim
spec:
  storageclassname: manual
  accessmodes:
    - readwriteonce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3gi

create the persistentvolumeclaim:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/pv-claim.yaml

after you create the persistentvolumeclaim, the kubernetes control plane looks for a persistentvolume that satisfies the claim's requirements.
if the control plane finds a suitable persistentvolume with the same storageclass, it binds the claim to the volume.
look again at the persistentvolume:

kubectl get pv task-pv-volume

now the output shows a status of bound.

name             capacity   accessmodes   reclaimpolicy   status    claim                   storageclass   reason    age

look at the persistentvolumeclaim:

kubectl get pvc task-pv-claim

the output shows that the persistentvolumeclaim is bound to your persistentvolume, task-pv-volume.

name            status    volume           capacity   accessmodes   storageclass   age
task-pv-claim   bound     task-pv-volume   10gi       rwo           manual         30s

========================================","managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute instances.
the persistentvolume subsystem provides an api for users and administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed.
to do this, we introduce two new api resources: persistentvolume and persistentvolumeclaim.
a persistentvolume (pv) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using storage classes .
it is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource.
pvs are volume plugins like volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the pv.
this api object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that nfs, iscsi, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.
a persistentvolumeclaim (pvc) is a request for storage by a user.
it is similar to a pod.
pods consume node resources and pvcs consume pv resources.
pods can request specific levels of resources (cpu and memory).
claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted readwriteonce, readonlymany, readwritemany, or readwriteoncepod, see accessmodes ).
while persistentvolumeclaims allow a user to consume abstract storage resources, it is common that users need persistentvolumes with varying properties, such as performance, for different problems.
cluster administrators need to be able to offer a variety of persistentvolumes that differ in more ways than size and access modes, without exposing users to the details of how those volumes are implemented.
for these needs, there is the storageclass resource.

readwritemany the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.
readwriteoncepod feature state:

kubernetes v1.29 [stable]

the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single pod.
use readwriteoncepod access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across the whole cluster can read that pvc or write to it.
note: the readwriteoncepod access mode is only supported for csi  volumes and kubernetes version 1.22+.
to use this feature you will need to update the following csi sidecars  to these versions or greater: csi-provisioner:v3.0.0+  csi-attacher:v3.3.0+  csi-resizer:v1.3.0+  in the cli, the access modes are abbreviated to: rwo - readwriteonce rox - readonlymany rwx - readwritemany rwop - readwriteoncepod note: kubernetes uses volume access modes to match persistentvolumeclaims and persistentvolumes.
in some cases, the volume access modes also constrain where the persistentvolume can be mounted.
volume access modes do not enforce write protection once the storage has been mounted.
even if the access modes are specified as readwriteonce, readonlymany, or readwritemany, they don't set any constraints on the volume.
for example, even if a persistentvolume is create the next step is to create a persistentvolumeclaim.
pods use persistentvolumeclaims to request physical storage.
in this exercise, you create a persistentvolumeclaim that requests a volume of at least three gibibytes that can provide read-write access for at most one node at a time.
here is the configuration file for the persistentvolumeclaim: pods/storage/pv-claim.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: persistentvolumeclaim
metadata:
  name: task-pv-claim
spec:
  storageclassname: manual
  accessmodes:
    - readwriteonce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3gi

create the persistentvolumeclaim:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/pv-claim.yaml

after you create the persistentvolumeclaim, the kubernetes control plane looks for a persistentvolume that satisfies the claim's requirements.
if the control plane finds a suitable persistentvolume with the same storageclass, it binds the claim to the volume.
look again at the persistentvolume:

kubectl get pv task-pv-volume

now the output shows a status of bound.

name             capacity   accessmodes   reclaimpolicy   status    claim                   storageclass   reason    age

look at the persistentvolumeclaim:

kubectl get pvc task-pv-claim

the output shows that the persistentvolumeclaim is bound to your persistentvolume, task-pv-volume.

name            status    volume           capacity   accessmodes   storageclass   age

======================================== managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute instances.
the persistentvolume subsystem provides an api for users and administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed.
to do this, we introduce two new api resources: persistentvolume and persistentvolumeclaim.
a persistentvolume (pv) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using storage classes .
it is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource.
pvs are volume plugins like volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the pv.
this api object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that nfs, iscsi, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.
a persistentvolumeclaim (pvc) is a request for storage by a user.
it is similar to a pod.
pods consume node resources and pvcs consume pv resources.
pods can request specific levels of resources (cpu and memory).
claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted readwriteonce, readonlymany, readwritemany, or readwriteoncepod, see accessmodes ).
while persistentvolumeclaims allow a user to consume abstract storage resources, it is common that users need persistentvolumes with varying properties, such as performance, for different problems.
cluster administrators need to be able to offer a variety of persistentvolumes that differ in more ways than size and access modes, without exposing users to the details of how those volumes are implemented.
for these needs, there is the storageclass resource.
see the detailed walkthrough with working examples .
========================================","<output_format>
The behavior you're observing is due to the nature of NFS (Network File System). While the access mode `ReadWriteOnce` is intended to allow a volume to be mounted as read-write by a single node, NFS can allow multiple clients to access the same volume simultaneously. This is because NFS operates at the file system level rather than the block level, which is how Kubernetes enforces access modes.

To ensure that only one pod can write to the volume at a time, you may need to implement additional application-level locking mechanisms or consider using a different storage solution that adheres strictly to the `ReadWriteOnce` access mode.

In summary, the `ReadWriteOnce` access mode does not enforce restrictions on NFS mounts, allowing multiple nodes to read and write concurrently. If you require strict enforcement of access modes, consider using a block storage solution instead of NFS.

### Explanation
I believe there is a misunderstanding regarding how your assets are being handled. If your assets are already included in the image at `/var/www`, mounting an `emptyDir` volume at that location will replace everything there with the empty directory's content, which is initially empty. This results in the loss of your assets, likely causing your Node server to fail.

To resolve this, you should mount the `emptyDir` volume at a different path, such as `/data`. Then, modify your Node container's command to copy the assets from `/var/www/*` to `/data`, which will be used for your `pwa-disk` volume. 

Additionally, it's important to clarify the role of init containers. They are designed to run and complete before any other containers in the pod start. Therefore, you should not run your Node server as an init container, as it is intended to remain running. Instead, declare your Node server alongside your Nginx container in the `containers` section. You can keep the asset copying command in the init container section, ensuring that the assets are copied to the volume before the main containers start. The overall structure should resemble the provided YAML configuration.","pods/storage/pv-duplicate.yaml

### Explanation:
1. **Init Container**: The Node.js container is set as an init container that runs a build command (`npm install && npm run build`) to prepare the application files before the Nginx container starts.
2. **Volume Sharing**: Both containers share the same `emptyDir` volume (`pwa-disk`), allowing the Nginx container to access the files generated by the Node.js init container.
3. **Corrected YAML**: The `apiVersion` is updated to `apps/v1`, which is the current standard for deployments.

### Explanation:
1. **Init Container**: The Node.js container is defined as an init container that executes the command to install dependencies and build the application. This ensures that the necessary files are available before the main application starts.
2. **Volume Sharing**: The `emptyDir` volume named `pwa-disk` is used to share files between the init container and the main Nginx container, allowing Nginx to serve the built application files.
3. **Deployment Selector**: The `selector` field is included to match the labels of the pods created by this deployment, which is a best practice for ensuring proper management of the pods.

This configuration is designed to ensure that the Nginx container can access the files generated by the Node.js init container without encountering file not found errors.","1212.0, 1663.0, 1358.0"

The user has a Kubernetes cluster with three nodes behind a firewall that they do not control. The firewall has a public IP that can forward traffic to the nodes on ports 80 and 443. The user initially configured MetalLB with a public IP address but is unsure if this is valid since the IP should be on the same subnet as the nodes, which use private IPs. They are able to receive responses from a local HTTP server on the public IP but not from outside the network.

### Explanation
To set up a Kubernetes cluster with an NGINX Ingress Controller that is accessible from the internet through a separate firewall, you need to consider a few key components. This setup assumes that your Kubernetes cluster is running in an internal network and that there is a firewall between the cluster and the internet. 

1. **MetalLB**: Since Kubernetes does not provide a built-in load balancer for bare metal clusters, you can use MetalLB to assign an external IP address to your services. This is particularly useful for on-premise setups where cloud provider load balancers are not available.

2. **NGINX Ingress Controller**: You will need to modify the service configuration of the NGINX Ingress Controller to work with MetalLB. This involves specifying the address pool in the service annotations.

3. **Firewall Configuration**: You will need to set up port forwarding on your firewall to direct traffic from the firewall's public IP to the internal IP assigned by MetalLB. For example, you would configure the firewall to forward traffic from `firewall_ip:80` to `single_ip:80` and `firewall_ip:443` to `single_ip:443`.

By following these steps, you can ensure that users can connect to your NGINX Ingress Controller, which will expose your application to the internet. For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the official Kubernetes documentation on creating external load balancers and configuring services.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source?

### Explanation
You cannot place your database in `/var/lib/postgres/data/whatever`. Instead, change the path to `/var/lib/postgres/whatever`, and it should function correctly.

When it comes to using secondary file systems, many setups create their database clusters on volumes other than the machine's root volume. If you opt for this approach, it is not recommended to use the topmost directory of the secondary volume (the mount point) as the data directory. The best practice is to create a subdirectory within the mount-point directory that is owned by the PostgreSQL user, and then establish the data directory within that. This method helps prevent permission issues, especially during operations like `pg_upgrade`, and ensures that failures are handled cleanly if the secondary volume goes offline.

Additionally, I had to create a secret, as it was not included in the post. Please note that the username must be ""postgres."" I'm not sure if you are addressing this in your setup.","the guestbook application uses redis to store its data.
creating the redis deployment the manifest file, included below, specifies a deployment controller that runs a single replica redis pod.

query the list of pods to verify that the redis pod is running:

run the following command to view the logs from the redis leader pod:

kubectl logs -f deployment/redis-leader

creating the redis leader service the guestbook application needs to communicate to the redis to write its data.
you need to apply a service  to proxy the traffic to the redis pod.
a service defines a policy to access the pods.

note: this manifest file creates a service named redis-leader with a set of labels that match the labels previously defined, so the service routes network traffic to the redis pod.
set up redis followers although the redis leader is a single pod, you can make it highly available and meet traffic demands by adding a few redis followers, or replicas.

the response should be similar to this:

name  ","a common scenario that you can detect using events is when you've created a pod that won't fit on any node.
for example, the pod might request more resources than are free on any node, or it might specify a label selector that doesn't match any nodes.
let's say we created the previous deployment with 5 replicas (instead of 2) and requesting 600 millicores instead of 500, on a four-node cluster where each (virtual) machine has 1 cpu.
in that case one of the pods will not be able to schedule.
(note that because of the cluster addon pods such as fluentd, skydns, etc., that run on each node, if we requested 1000 millicores then none of the pods would be able to schedule.)

kubectl get pods

nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd   0/1       pending   0          1m

to find out why the nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd pod is not running, we can use

kubectl describe pod

on the pending pod and look at its events:

kubectl describe pod nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd



name:		nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd

  fit failure on node (kubernetes-node-wul5): node didn't have enough resource: cpu, requested: 1000, used: 1100, capacity: 2000

here you can see the event generated by the scheduler saying that the pod failed to schedule for reason failedscheduling (and possibly others).
the message tells us that there were not enough resources for the pod on any of the nodes.
to correct this situation, you can use kubectl scale to update your deployment to specify four or fewer replicas.
(or you could leave the one pod pending, which is harmless.) events such as the ones you saw at the end of

kubectl describe pod

are persisted in etcd and provide high-level information on what is happening in the cluster.
to list all events you can use

kubectl get events

but you have to remember that events are namespaced.
this means that if you're interested in events for some namespaced object (e.g.
what happened with pods in namespace my-namespace) you need to explicitly provide a namespace to the command:

kubectl get events --namespace=my-namespace

to see events from all namespaces, you can use the --all-namespaces argument.
in addition to

kubectl describe pod

, another way to get extra information about a pod (beyond what is provided by

kubectl get pod

) is to pass the -o yaml output format flag to

kubectl get pod

.
this will give you, in yaml format, even more information than

kubectl describe pod

--essentially all of the information the system has about the pod.
here you will see things like annotations (which are key-value metadata without the label restrictions, that is used internally by kubernete","the first step in troubleshooting is triage.
what is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.
check the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:

kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}

look at the state of the containers in the pod.
are they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.
my pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.
generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.
look at the output of the

kubectl describe ...

command above.
there should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.
reasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
see compute resources document  for more information.
you are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.
in most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.
if you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.
my pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.
again, the information from

kubectl describe ...

should be informative.
the most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.
there are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
have you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.
for example, if you use docker on your pc, run

docker pull &lt;image&gt;

.
my pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.
this typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.
to identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.
if the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.
disable the webhook for update operations.
report an issue with the corresponding provider.
if you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.
for example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.
for a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.
in other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.
this allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.
my pod is crashing or otherwise unhealthy once your pod has been scheduled, the methods described in debug running pods  are available for debugging.
my pod is running but not doing what i told it to do if your pod is not behaving as you expected, it may be that there was an error in your pod description (e.g.

mypod.yaml

file on your local machine), and that the error was silently ignored when you created the pod.
often a section of the pod description is nested incorrectly, or a key name is typed incorrectly, and so the key is ignored.
for example, if you misspelled command as commnd then the pod will be created but will not use the command line you intended it to use.
the first thing to do is to delete your pod and try creating it again with the --validate option.
for example, run

kubectl apply --va","the guestbook application uses redis to store its data.

kubectl get pods

the response should be similar to this:

name   a common scenario that you can detect using events is when you've created a pod that won't fit on any node.
for example, the pod might request more resources than are free on any node, or it might specify a label selector that doesn't match any nodes.
let's say we created the previous deployment with 5 replicas (instead of 2) and requesting 600 millicores instead of 500, on a four-node cluster where each (virtual) machine has 1 cpu.
in that case one of the pods will not be able to schedule.
(note that because of the cluster addon pods such as fluentd, skydns, etc., that run on each node, if we requested 1000 millicores then none of the pods would be able to schedule.)

kubectl get pods

nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd   0/1       pending   0          1m

to find out why the nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd pod is not running, we can use

kubectl describe pod

on the pending pod and look at its events:

kubectl describe pod nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd



name:		nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd

  fit failure on node (kubernetes-node-wul5): node didn't have enough resource: cpu, requested: 1000, used: 1100, capacity: 2000

here you can see the event generated by the scheduler saying that the pod failed to schedule for reason failedscheduling (and possibly others).
the message tells us that there were not enough resources for the pod on any of the nodes.
to correct this situation, you can use kubectl scale to update your deployment to specify four or fewer replicas.
(or you could leave the one pod pending, which is harmless.) events such as the ones you saw at the end of

kubectl describe pod

are persisted in etcd and provide high-level information on what is happening in the cluster.
to list all events you can use

kubectl get events

but you have to remember that events are namespaced.
this means that if you're interested in events for some namespaced object (e.g.
what happened with pods in namespace my-namespace) you need to explicitly provide a namespace to the command:

kubectl get events --namespace=my-namespace

to see events from all namespaces, you can use the --all-namespaces argument.
in addition to

kubectl describe pod

, another way to get extra information about a pod (beyond what is provided by

kubectl get pod

) is to pass the -o yaml output format flag to

kubectl get pod

.
this will give you, in yaml format, even more information than

kubectl describe pod

--essentially all of the information the system has about the pod.
here you will see things like annotations (which are key-value metadata without the label restrictions, that is used internally by kubernete the first step in troubleshooting is triage.
what is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.
check the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:

kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}

look at the state of the containers in the pod.
are they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.
my pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.
generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.
look at the output of the

kubectl describe ...

command above.
there should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.
reasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
see compute resources document  for more information.
you are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.
in most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.
if you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.
my pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.
again, the information from

kubectl describe ...

should be informative.
the most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.
there are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
have you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.
for example, if you use docker on your pc, run

docker pull &lt;image&gt;

.
my pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.
this typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.
to identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.
if the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.
disable the webhook for update operations.
report an issue with the corresponding provider.
if you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.
for example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.
for a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.
in other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.
this allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.
my pod is crashing or otherwise unhealthy once your pod has been scheduled, the methods described in debug running pods  are available for debugging.
my pod is running but not doing what i told it to do if your pod is not behaving as you expected, it may be that there was an error in your pod description (e.g.

mypod.yaml

file on your local machine), and that the error was silently ignored when you created the pod.
often a section of the pod description is nested incorrectly, or a key name is typed incorrectly, and so the key is ignored.
for example, if you misspelled command as commnd then the pod will be created but will not use the command line you intended it to use.
the first thing to do is to delete your pod and try creating it again with the --validate option.
for example, run

kubectl apply --va","```yaml

**Explanation:** The issue arises because the PostgreSQL initialization process fails when the data directory is not empty.

<summary>
The user is trying to set up a Kubernetes environment using Kustomize overlays to manage multiple environments (test, stage, prod) while sharing a ConfigMap across different pods. They have structured their directories to separate base resources and overlays for each environment but are encountering various errors related to resource sharing, namespace existence, and file path issues. The user seeks guidance on how to effectively share the ConfigMap and minimize YAML boilerplate while ensuring that the configuration works correctly across different environments.

The `example.properties` file includes:
```
some_other_var=somevalue
conf_env=test

The `kustomization.yaml` file contains:
```yaml
resources:

In the overlays directory, I have two defined overlays: `test` and `prod`:
```bash
$ cd ../overlays
$ tree
.
├── prod
│   ├── example.properties
│   └── kustomization.yaml
└── test
    └── kustomization.yaml
```

The `test/kustomization.yaml` file looks like this:
```yaml
resources:
- ../../base
```
This simply imports the base configuration without any modifications, as the `conf_env` value from the base directory is set to `test`.

The `prod/kustomization.yaml` file is structured as follows:
```yaml

The `prod/example.properties` file contains:
```

When I execute `kustomize build overlays/test`, the output is:

This demonstrates that the configuration behaves as expected based on the base setup, while allowing for a new value for `conf_env` in the production overlay. You can find all these files in the specified directories.","kustomize is a tool for customizing kubernetes configurations.
it has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.
the source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:
  - .env
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

however, it uses its loc","kustomize is a tool for customizing kubernetes configurations.
it has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.
the source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:
  - .env
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

### Explanation
While Helm hooks are commonly implemented as jobs, there is no strict requirement for them to be so, and Helm does not analyze the contents of a hook object for dependencies. The installation sequence follows these steps: (7) install resources tagged as hooks, (8) wait for those to be ready, and then (9) install the remaining resources; it ensures that the job completes before proceeding to install any dependent secrets. 

To ensure your secret is installed during the pre-install phase, you must tag it as a hook with a modified weight, allowing it to be installed before the main job (lower weight numbers indicate earlier installation). 

Regarding the deletion of this secret, the documentation specifies that `helm uninstall` will not remove hook resources. To manage this, you need to add a separate `helm.sh/hook-delete-policy` annotation; otherwise, the secret will persist until the next scheduled execution of the hook. This implies that if you modify the secret (or its values) and upgrade the chart (instead of deleting and reinstalling), the secret will not be updated. 

A practical approach would be to create two versions of the secret: one for pre-installation and another for the primary chart lifecycle. You can define a template for the secret's content and invoke it twice.","creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.
secret/optional-secret.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      optional: true

by default, secrets are required.
none of a pod's containers will start until all non-optional secrets are available.
if a pod references a specific key in a non-optional secret and that secret does exist, but is missing the named key, the pod fails during startup.
using secrets as files from a pod if you want to access data from a secret in a pod, one way to do that is to have kubernetes make the value of that secret be available as a file inside the filesystem of one or more of the pod's containers.
for instructions, refer to create a pod that has access to the secret data through a volume .
when a volume contains data from a secret, and that secret is updated, kubernetes tracks this and updates the data in the volume, using an eventually-consistent approach.
note: a container using a secret as a subpath  volume mount does not receive automated secret updates.

provide credentials such as ssh keys or passwords to pods .
allow the kubelet to pull container images from private registries .
the kubernetes control plane also uses secrets; for example, bootstrap token secrets  are a mechanism to help automate node registration.
use case: dotfiles in a secret volume you can make your data ""hidden"" by defining a key that begins with a dot.
this key represents a dotfile or ""hidden"" file.
for example, when the following secret is mounted into a volume, secret-volume, the volume will contain a single file, called

.secret-file

, and the dotfile-test-container will have this file present at the path

/etc/secret-volume/.secret-file

.
note: files beginning with dot characters are hidden from the output of ls -l; you must use ls -la to see them when listing directory contents.

use case: secret visible to one container in a pod consider a program that needs to handle http requests, do some complex business logic, and then sign some messages with an hmac.
because it has complex application logic, there might be an unnoticed remote file reading exploit in the server, which could expose the private key to an attacker.
this could be divided into two processes in two containers: a frontend container which handles user interaction and business logic, but which cannot see the private key; and a signer container that can see the private key, and responds to simple signing requests from the frontend (for example, over localhost networking).
with this partitioned approach, an attacker now has to trick the application server into doing something rather arbitrary, which may be harder than getting it to read a file.
alternatives to secrets rather than using a secret to protect confidential data, you can pick from alternatives.
here are some of your options: if your cloud-native component needs to authenticate to another application that you know is running within the same kubernetes cluster, you can use a serviceaccount  and its tokens to identify your client.
there are third-party tools that you can run, either within or outside your cluster, that manage sensitive data.
for example, a service that pods access over https, that reveals a secret if the client correctly authenticates (for example, with a serviceaccount token).
for authentication, you can implement a custom signer for x.509 certificates, and use certificatesigningrequests  to let that custom signer issue certificates to pods that need them.
you can use a device plugin  to expose node-local encryption hardware to a specific pod.
for example, you can schedule trusted pods onto nodes that provide a trusted platform module, configured out-of-band.
you can also combine two or more of those options, including the option to use secret objects themselves.
for example: implement (or deploy) an operator  that fetches short-lived session tokens from an external service, and then creates secrets based on those short-lived session tokens.
pods running in your cluster can make use of the session tokens, and operator ensures they are valid.
this separation means that you can run pods that are unaware of the exact mechanisms for issuing and refreshing those session tokens.
========================================","creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.
secret/optional-secret.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      optional: true

by default, secrets are required.
none of a pod's containers will start until all non-optional secrets are available.
if a pod references a specific key in a non-optional secret and that secret does exist, but is missing the named key, the pod fails during startup.
using secrets as files from a pod if you want to access data from a secret in a pod, one way to do that is to have kubernetes make the value of that secret be available as a file inside the filesystem of one or more of the pod's containers.
for instructions, refer to create a pod that has access to the secret data through a volume .
when a volume contains data from a secret, and that secret is updated, kubernetes tracks this and updates the data in the volume, using an eventually-consistent approach.
note: a container using a secret as a subpath  volume mount does not receive automated secret updates.
the kubelet keeps a cache of the curren hooks are just kubernetes manifest files with special annotations in the
 metadata  section. because they are template files, you can use all of the
normal template features, including reading  .values ,  .release , and

    ""helm.sh/hook"":  post-installone resource can implement multiple hooks:annotations : 
    ""helm.sh/hook"":  post-install,post-upgradesimilarly, there is no limit to the number of different resources that may
implement a given hook. for example, one could declare both a secret and a
config map as a pre-install hook.when subcharts declare hooks, those are also evaluated. there is no way for a
top-level chart to disable the hooks declared by subcharts.it is possible to define a weight for a hook which will help build a
deterministic executing order. weights are defined using the following
annotation:annotations : 
    ""helm.sh/hook-weight"":  ""5""hook weights can be positive or negative numbers but must be represented as
strings. when helm starts the execution cycle of hooks of a particular kind it
will sort those hooks in ascending order.hook deletion policiesit is possible to define policies that determine when to delete corresponding
hook resources. hook deletion policies are defined using the following
annotation:annotations : 
    ""helm.sh/hook-delete-policy"":  before-hook-creation,hook-succeededyou can choose one or more defined annotation values:annotation value description before-hook-creation delete the previous resource before a new hook is launched (default) hook-succeeded delete the resource after the hook is successfully executed hook-failed delete the resource if the hook failed during executionif no hook deletion policy annotation is specified, the  before-hook-creation 
behavior applies by default.prev ← charts next chart tests → you can use secrets for purposes such as the following: set environment variables for a container .
provide credentials such as ssh keys or passwords to pods .
allow the kubelet to pull container images from private registries .
the kubernetes control plane also uses secrets; for example, bootstrap token secrets  are a mechanism to help automate node registration.
use case: dotfiles in a secret volume you can make your data ""hidden"" by defining a key that begins with a dot.
this key represents a dotfile or ""hidden"" file.
for example, when the following secret is mounted into a volume, secret-volume, the volume will contain a single file, called

.secret-file

, and the dotfile-test-container will have this file present at the path

/etc/secret-volume/.secret-file

.
note: files beginning with dot characters are hidden from the output of ls -l; you must use ls -la to see them when listing directory contents.

        - name: secret-volume
          readonly: true
          mountpath: ""/etc/secret-volume""

use case: secret visible to one container in a pod consider a program that needs to handle http requests, do some complex business logic, and then sign some messages with an hmac.
because it has complex application logic, there might be an unnoticed remote file reading exploit in the server, which could expose the private key to an attacker.
this could be divided into two processes in two containers: a frontend container which handles user interaction and business logic, but which cannot see the private key; and a signer container that can see the private key, and responds to simple signing requests from the frontend (for example, over localhost networking).
with this partitioned approach, an attacker now has to trick the application server into doing something rather arbitrary, which may be harder than getting it to read a file.
alternatives to secrets rather than using a secret to protect confidential data, you can pick from alternatives.
here are some of your options: if your cloud-native component needs to authenticate to another application that you know is running within the same kubernetes cluster, you can use a serviceaccount  and its tokens to identify your client.

To ensure that the Secret is available before the pre-install job executes, you need to create the Secret resource before the job. This can be done by defining the Secret in your Helm chart and ensuring it is included in the installation order. The annotations you've used for the job are correct, but make sure the Secret is defined in the same chart and is created before the job runs.","```yaml

### Explanation
I discovered that the only adjustment I needed to make was to inform the nginx-ingress-controller that I was expecting HTTPS connections. The final YAML configuration for exposing the service is as shown above. The `ingress` resource has transitioned to `networking.k8s.io/v1`, and the previous `extensions/v1beta1` version is deprecated. The notable changes include the requirement to specify `pathType` explicitly and the renaming of fields to align with the new API version.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","official document: !!! attention     when using this annotation with the nginx annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity` of type `cookie`,  `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-path` must be also set; session cookie paths do not support regex.  using the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex` annotation will indicate whether or not the paths defined on an ingress use regular expressions.  the default value is `false`.  the following will indicate that regular expression paths are being used: ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true"" ```  the following will indicate that regular expression paths are __not__ being used: ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""false"" ```  when this annotation is set to `true`, the case insensitive regular expression [location modifier](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) will be enforced on all paths for a given host regardless of what ingress they are defined on.  additionally, if the [`rewrite-target` annotation](#rewrite) is used on any ingress for a given host, then the case insensitive regular expression [location modifier](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) will be enforced on all paths for a given host regardless of what ingress they are defined on.  please read about [ingress path matching](../ingress-path-matching.md) before using this modifier. medium website: first, please consider enhancing your application so that it doesnt require session affinity! the problem if you absolutely must move forward with session affinity using ingress-nginx controller, you may find that it doesnt work initially. consider the following ingress object apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata name helloworld-deployment-ingress annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target 1 nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex true nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioaffinity cookie spec ingressclassname myingressclass rules - http paths - path helloworld. pathtype prefix backend service name helloworld-deployment-svc port number 8080 when this ingress is accessed, your first request is handled by one pod hello, world!

**Explanation:** The issue with ""ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS"" is likely due to incorrect port configuration in the Ingress resource. The Ingress should route traffic to the service on port 80, not 443. Additionally, the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect` annotation is added to ensure that HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS properly. The `pathType` is also specified to ensure compatibility with the latest Kubernetes API.","```yaml

**Explanation:** The ""ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS"" error may stem from a misconfiguration in your Ingress resource. Ensure that the Ingress is correctly routing traffic to the service on port 80, as specified in the configuration. The annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: ""true""` is included to facilitate the redirection of HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Additionally, the `pathType: Prefix` is specified to align with the latest Kubernetes API requirements.

```

### Explanation
The `configMapRef` and `secretRef` for the `envFrom` and `valueFrom` functions are limited to environment variables, which means they cannot be utilized in this context. As of Kubernetes version 1.18.0, the desired functionality is not natively supported. 

However, it is achievable through tools like Helm and Kustomize, which are among the best options for this purpose. Helm acts as a templating engine for Kubernetes manifests, allowing you to create generic manifests and define the differences between your desired configurations using variables in a separate file. At runtime, these variables are automatically injected into the template.

Kustomize, which I personally recommend, offers a different approach. It generates customized manifests from generic ones without using templating. Instead, Kustomize performs merge patches between YAML or JSON files at runtime, referred to as overlays. This makes it particularly effective for managing environments with numerous manifests, as it can handle recursive directory structures of bases and overlays, enhancing scalability.

To implement this, you would start by creating a `kustomization.yml` file where you define your resources, such as `myingress`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - myingress.yml
```

Next, set up a directory structure. Create a directory named `example` with a subdirectory called `base`. Inside `./example/base/`, create a `kustomization.yml` file with the above content. Then, create a `myingress.yml` file in the same directory and populate it with the following ingress configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myingress
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
      - config.my_domain
      secretName: mytls
  rules:
    - host: config.my_domain
      http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: myservice
              servicePort: 3000
```

Now, define your first overlay by creating a directory `./example/overlays/domain-a` and adding a `kustomization.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
bases:
  - ../../../base/
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - ing_patch.yml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: config_a
    literals:
      - my_domain='domain_a'
```

Next, create the patch file `ing_patch.yml` in the same overlay directory:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myingress
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
      - domain.a.com
  rules:
    - host: domain.a.com
```

With this setup, you can now generate the final manifest using either `kubectl` or `kustomize`:

```bash
kubectl kustomize ./example/overlays/domain_a
# or
kustomize build ./example/overlays/domain_a
```

Running one of these commands will produce output containing the two files, `myingress` and `config`, with `myingress` reflecting the domain configuration specified in your overlay's patch.

You might wonder why Kustomize exists if `kubectl` supports similar features. Kustomize originated as an external project, and its binary often runs a newer version than what's available in `kubectl`.

To create a second overlay, simply copy the first one:

```bash
cp -r ./example/overlays/domain_a ./example/overlays/domain_b
```

Then, modify `./example/overlays/domain_b/ing_patch.yml` to reflect the new domain:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myingress
spec:
  tls:
    - hosts:
      - domain.b.com
  rules:
    - host: domain.b.com
```

After saving the changes, build both overlays:

```bash
kustomize build ./example/overlays/domain_a
kustomize build ./example/overlays/domain_b
```

Notice how the output varies based on the patches in each overlay directory. You can continue to abstract this pattern by nesting bases and overlays, allowing for powerful and efficient scaling of your project. Finally, apply the configurations to your API server:

```bash
kubectl apply -k ./example/overlays/domain_a
kubectl apply -k ./example/overlays/domain_b
```

This is just the beginning of what Kustomize can do. As indicated by the `configMapGenerator` field in each overlay's `kustomization.yml`, Kustomize includes many features, such as adding labels to resources, overriding namespaces, and modifying container image information.

this pops up an editor with the existing configuration in yaml format.
modify it to include the new host:

after you save your changes, kubectl updates the resource in the api server, which tells the ingress controller to reconfigure the load balancer.
verify this:

The original Ingress configuration had an issue with using a ConfigMap variable directly in the YAML, which is not supported.

### Explanation
I successfully managed to get it working! Essentially, I made modifications to both the `ingress.yaml` and `service.yaml` files. The `ingress.yaml` file has been updated to use the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API version, which is the current standard. The previous `extensions/v1beta1` version is deprecated. Notable changes include the requirement to specify `pathType` for each path and the updated structure for the backend service references. 

For the `service.yaml`, it remains in the `v1` API version, but I ensured that the service definitions align with the latest standards. The service exposes both HTTP and HTTPS ports, targeting the appropriate backend application.","official document: in some scenarios the exposed url in the backend service differs from the specified path in the ingress rule. without a rewrite any request will return 404. set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` to the path expected by the service.  if the application root is exposed in a different path and needs to be redirected, set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root` to redirect requests for `/`.  !!! example     please check the [rewrite](../../examples/rewrite/readme.md) example. github pages: this example demonstrates how to use rewrite annotations. prerequisites you will need to make sure your ingress targets exactly one ingress controller by specifying the ingress.class annotation, and that you have an ingress controller running in your cluster. deployment rewriting can be controlled using the following annotations name description values nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target target uri where the traffic must be redirected string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iossl-redirect indicates if the location section is only accessible via ssl defaults to true when ingress contains a certificate bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioforce-ssl-redirect forces the redirection to https even if the ingress is not tls enabled bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root defines the application root that the controller must redirect if its in context string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex indicates if the paths defined on an ingress use regular expressions bool. create an ingress rule with a rewrite annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex true nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target 2 name rewrite namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host rewrite.bar.com http paths - path something. pathtype implementationspecific backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - in this ingress definition, any characters captured by . will be assigned to the placeholder 2, which is then used as a parameter in the rewrite-target annotation. for example, the ingress definition above will result in the following rewrites rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomethingnew rewrites to rewrite.bar.comnew app root create an ingress rule with an app-root annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root app1 name approot namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host approot.bar.com http paths - path pathtype prefix backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - check the rewrite is working curl -i -k httpapproot.bar.com http1.1 302 moved temporarily server nginx1.11.10 date mon, 13 mar 2017 145715 gmt content-type texthtml content-length 162 location httpapproot.bar.comapp1 connection keep-alive. medium website: example 1 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target destination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one does a transparent reverse proxy. it does not update the location header so the url in the browser does not change. example 2 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target httpsnginx.redirectdestination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one changes the location header and the url in the browser is updated http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsource location httpsnginx.redirectdestination http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsourcebar location httpsnginx.redirectdestinationbar this is because the replacement string as specified in rewrite-target an","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","till now we have only accessed the nginx server from within the cluster.
before exposing the service to the internet, you want to make sure the communication channel is secure.
for this, you will need: self signed certificates for https (unless you already have an identity certificate) an nginx server configured to use the certificates a secret  that makes the certificates accessible to pods you can acquire all these from the nginx https example .
this requires having go and make tools installed.
if you don't want to install those, then follow the manual steps later.
in short:

make keys key=/tmp/nginx.key cert=/tmp/nginx.crt
kubectl create secret tls nginxsecret --key /tmp/nginx.key --cert /tmp/nginx.crt

secret/nginxsecret created

kubectl get secrets

nginxsecret           kubernetes.io/tls                     2         1m

and also the configmap:

kubectl create configmap nginxconfigmap --from-file=default.conf

you can find an example for

default.conf

in the kubernetes examples project repo .
configmap/nginxconfigmap created

kubectl get configmaps



name             data   age
nginxconfigmap   1      114s

you can view the details of the nginxconfigmap configmap using the following command:

kubectl describe configmap  nginxconfigmap

the output is similar to:

before exposing the service to the internet, you want to make sure the communication channel is secure.
for this, you will need: self signed certificates for https (unless you already have an identity certificate) an nginx server configured to use the certificates a secret  that makes the certificates accessible to pods you can acquire all these from the nginx https example .
this requires having go and make tools installed.
if you don't want to install those, then follow the manual steps later.

### Explanation:
The issue likely stems from the incorrect configuration of the `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.ssl-redirect` annotation. Ensure that the `redirectConfig` is correctly formatted and that the `statusCode` is specified as `HTTP_301` (with an underscore). This configuration will redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS as intended. 

Make sure to validate the YAML syntax and ensure that the Ingress controller is properly set up to handle these annotations.","```yaml

              servicePort: 3000
```

### Explanation:
The configuration appears to be mostly correct, but there are a few points to verify:

1. **Redirect Configuration**: Ensure that the `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.ssl-redirect` annotation is correctly formatted. The `redirectConfig` should specify the `protocol`, `port`, and `statusCode` accurately, which you have done.

2. **Service Names and Ports**: Confirm that the service names (`ssl-redirect` and `metabase`) and their respective ports (`use-annotation` for the redirect and `3000` for Metabase) are correctly defined in your Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Ingress Class**: Make sure that the Ingress controller is set up to recognize the `alb` ingress class, as this is necessary for the annotations to be processed correctly.

4. **Path Configuration**: The paths defined with `/*` may need to be adjusted based on your routing requirements. If you intend to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, ensure that the `ssl-redirect` service is properly configured to handle this.

If you continue to experience issues, consider checking the logs of the Ingress controller for any errors related to the configuration.","3389.0, 3397.0, 1882.0"

### Explanation
You can also utilize a global variable `$` that references the root context. This allows you to access values defined at the top level of your Helm chart. The example demonstrates how to create a ConfigMap with various data entries, including a default drink and food, as well as a list of toppings. The use of functions like `default`, `upper`, and `title` helps in formatting the values appropriately.","many programming languages have support for looping using  for  loops,  foreach 
loops, or similar functional mechanisms. in helm's template language, the way to
iterate through a collection is to use the  range  operator.to start, let's add a list of pizza toppings to our  values.yaml  file:favorite : 
    drink :   coffee 
    food :   pizza 
 pizzatoppings : 
    - mushrooms 
    - cheese 
    - peppers 
    - onions 
    - pineapplenow we have a list (called a  slice  in templates) of  pizzatoppings . we can
modify our template to print this list into our configmap:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
    toppings :   |- 
     {{- range .values.pizzatoppings }}
     - {{ . | title | quote }}
     {{- end }}we can use  $  for accessing the list  values.pizzatoppings  from the parent
scope.  $  is mapped to the root scope when template execution begins and it
does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    toppings :   |- 
     {{- range $.values.pizzatoppings }}
     - {{ . | title | quote }}
     {{- end }}     
    {{- end }}let's take a closer look at the  toppings:  list. the  range  function will
""range over"" (iterate through) the  pizzatoppings  list. but now something
interesting happens. just like  with  sets the scope of  . , so does a  range 
operator. each time through the loop,  .  is set to the current pizza topping.
that is, the first time,  .  is set to  mushrooms . the second iteration it is
set to  cheese , and so on.we can send the value of  .  directly down a pipeline, so when we do  {{ . | title | quote }} , it sends  .  to  title  (title case function) and then to
 quote . if we run this template, the output will be:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml 
 apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   edgy-dragonfly-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    drink :   ""coffee"" 
    food :   ""pizza"" 
    toppings :   |- 
     - ""mushrooms""
     - ""cheese""
     - ""peppers""
     - ""onions""
     - ""pineapple""now, in this example we've done something tricky. the  toppings: |-  line is
declaring a multi-line string. so our list of toppings is actually not a yaml
list. it's a big string. why would we do this? because the data in configmaps
 data  is composed of key/value pairs, where both the key and the value are
simple strings. to understand why this is the case, take a look at the
 kubernetes configmap docs .
for us, though, this detail doesn't matter much.the  |-  marker in yaml takes a multi-line string. this can be a useful
technique for embedding big blocks of data inside of your manifests, as
exemplified here.sometimes it's useful to be able to quickly make a list inside of your template,
and then iterate over that list. helm templates have a function to make this
easy:  tuple . in computer science, a tuple is a list-like collection of fixed
size, but with arbitrary data types. this roughly conveys the way a  tuple  is
used.sizes :   |- 
     {{- range tuple ""small"" ""medium"" ""large"" }}
     - {{ . }}
     {{- end }}the above will produce this:sizes :   |- 
     - small
     - medium
     - largein addition to lists and tuples,  range  can be used to iterate over collections
that have a key and a value (like a  map  or  dict ). we'll see how to do that
in the next section when we introduce template variables.prev ← template function list next variables →","the next control structure to look at is the  with  action. this controls
variable scoping. recall that  .  is a reference to  the current scope . so
 .values  tells the template to find the  values  object in the current scope.the syntax for  with  is similar to a simple  if  statement:{{ with pipeline }}
   # restricted scope
 {{ end }}scopes can be changed.  with  can allow you to set the current scope ( . ) to a
particular object. for example, we've been working with  .values.favorite .
let's rewrite our configmap to alter the  .  scope to point to
 .values.favorite :apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }}note that we removed the  if  conditional from the previous exercise
because it is now unnecessary - the block after  with  only executes
if the value of  pipeline  is not empty.notice that now we can reference  .drink  and  .food  without qualifying them.
that is because the  with  statement sets  .  to point to  .values.favorite .
the  .  is reset to its previous scope after  {{ end }} .but here's a note of caution! inside of the restricted scope, you will not be
able to access the other objects from the parent scope using  . . this, for
example, will fail:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }} 
    {{- end }}it will produce an error because  release.name  is not inside of the restricted
scope for  . . however, if we swap the last two lines, all will work as expected
because the scope is reset after  {{ end }} .{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }}or, we can use  $  for accessing the object  release.name  from the parent
scope.  $  is mapped to the root scope when template execution begins and it
does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   $.release.name }} 
    {{- end }}after looking at  range , we will take a look at template variables, which offer
one solution to the scoping issue above.","one function frequently used in templates is the  default  function:  default default_value given_value . this function allows you to specify a default value
inside of the template, in case the value is omitted. let's use it to modify the
drink example above:drink :   {{   .values.favorite.drink | default ""tea"" | quote }}if we run this as normal, we'll get our  coffee :# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml

we'll see those in the next section.template functions and pipelines are a powerful way to transform information and
then insert it into your yaml. but sometimes it's necessary to add some template
logic that is a little more sophisticated than just inserting a string. in the
next section we will look at the control structures provided by the template
language.","many programming languages have support for looping using  for  loops,  foreach 
loops, or similar functional mechanisms. in helm's template language, the way to
iterate through a collection is to use the  range  operator.to start, let's add a list of pizza toppings to our  values.yaml  file:favorite : 
    drink :   coffee 
    food :   pizza 
 pizzatoppings : 
    - mushrooms 
    - cheese 
    - peppers 
    - onions 
    - pineapplenow we have a list (called a  slice  in templates) of  pizzatoppings . we can
modify our template to print this list into our configmap:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
    toppings :   |- 
     {{- range .values.pizzatoppings }}
     - {{ . | title | quote }}
     {{- end }}we can use  $  for accessing the list  values.pizzatoppings  from the parent
scope.  $  is mapped to the root scope when template execution begins and it
does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    toppings :   |- 
     {{- range $.values.pizzatoppings }}
     - {{ . | title | quote }}
     {{- end }}     
    {{- end }}let's take a closer look at the  toppings:  list. the  range  function will
""range over"" (iterate through) the  pizzatoppings  list. but now something
interesting happens. just like  with  sets the scope of  . , so does a  range 
operator. each time through the loop,  .  is set to the current pizza topping.
that is, the first time,  .  is set to  mushrooms . the second iteration it is
set to  cheese , and so on.we can send the value of  .  directly down a pipeline, so when we do  {{ . | title | quote }} , it sends  .  to  title  (title case function) and then to
 quote . if we run this template, the output will be:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml 
 apiversion :   v1

    name :   edgy-dragonfly-configmap

    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    drink :   ""coffee"" 
    food :   ""pizza"" 
    toppings :   |- 
     - ""mushrooms""
     - ""cheese""
     - ""peppers""
     - ""onions""
     - ""pineapple""now, in this example we've done something tricky. the  toppings: |-  line is
declaring a multi-line string. so our list of toppings is actually not a yaml
list. it's a big string. why would we do this? because the data in configmaps
 data  is composed of key/value pairs, where both the key and the value are
simple strings. to understand why this is the case, take a look at the
 kubernetes configmap docs .
for us, though, this detail doesn't matter much.the  |-  marker in yaml takes a multi-line string. this can be a useful
technique for embedding big blocks of data inside of your manifests, as
exemplified here.sometimes it's useful to be able to quickly make a list inside of your template,
and then iterate over that list. helm templates have a function to make this
easy:  tuple . in computer science, a tuple is a list-like collection of fixed
size, but with arbitrary data types. this roughly conveys the way a  tuple  is
used.sizes :   |- 
     {{- range tuple ""small"" ""medium"" ""large"" }}
     - {{ . }}
     {{- end }}the above will produce this:sizes :   |- 
     - small
     - medium
     - largein addition to lists and tuples,  range  can be used to iterate over collections
that have a key and a value (like a  map  or  dict ). we'll see how to do that
in the next section when we introduce template variables.prev ← template function list next variables → the next control structure to look at is the  with  action. this controls
variable scoping. recall that  .  is a reference to  the current scope . so
 .values  tells the template to find the  values  object in the current scope.the syntax for  with  is similar to a simple  if  statement:{{ with pipeline }}
   # restricted scope
 {{ end }}scopes can be changed.  with  can allow you to set the current scope ( . ) to a
particular object. for example, we've been working with  .values.favorite .
let's rewrite our configmap to alter the  .  scope to point to
 .values.favorite :apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }}note that we removed the  if  conditional from the previous exercise
because it is now unnecessary - the block after  with  only executes
if the value of  pipeline  is not empty.notice that now we can reference  .drink  and  .food  without qualifying them.
that is because the  with  statement sets  .  to point to  .values.favorite .
the  .  is reset to its previous scope after  {{ end }} .but here's a note of caution! inside of the restricted scope, you will not be
able to access the other objects from the parent scope using  . . this, for
example, will fail:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }} 
    {{- end }}it will produce an error because  release.name  is not inside of the restricted
scope for  . . however, if we swap the last two lines, all will work as expected
because the scope is reset after  {{ end }} .{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }}or, we can use  $  for accessing the object  release.name  from the parent
scope.  $  is mapped to the root scope when template execution begins and it
does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   $.release.name }} 
    {{- end }}after looking at  range , we will take a look at template variables, which offer
one solution to the scoping issue above. one function frequently used in templates is the  default  function:  default default_value given_value . this function allows you to specify a default value
inside of the template, in case the value is omitted. let's use it to modify the
drink example above:drink :   {{   .values.favorite.drink | default ""tea"" | quote }}if we run this as normal, we'll get our  coffee :# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml 
 apiversion :   v1

    {{- range .values.pizzatoppings }}
    - {{ . | title | quote }}
    {{- end }}
  drink: {{ $.values.favorite.drink | default ""tea"" | quote }}
```

In this fix, I moved the reference to `$.values.favorite.drink` outside of the `range` loop. The `$` symbol allows access to the root scope, enabling you to reference top-level values like `drink` from within the loop. This resolves the issue of accessing top-level values while iterating through the `pizzatoppings`.","```yaml

  {{- end }}
  toppings: |-
    {{- range .values.pizzatoppings }}
    - {{ . | title | quote }}
    {{- end }}
```

In this configuration, the reference to `$.values.favorite.drink` has been removed from the `toppings` section, as it was not necessary to include it there. The `drink` value is already defined within the `with` block for `.values.favorite`, ensuring that it is set correctly. If you need to access the `drink` value outside of the `with` block, you can do so by using `$.values.favorite.drink` in other parts of the template. This maintains clarity and avoids redundancy in the configuration.","3598.0, 3597.0, 3574.0"

### Explanation
The `configuration-snippet` annotation is used to add configurations to specific locations within the NGINX server. If you need to introduce a custom location within the server context, you should utilize the `server-snippet` annotation instead. By using `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet`, you can insert custom configurations directly into the server block of the NGINX configuration.

To ensure proper functionality, you may need to apply certain modifiers and regular expressions, such as `~*` for case-insensitive matching and `^` for matching the start of a string. The provided configuration should work effectively. 

After applying the configuration, you can verify the final NGINX configuration by executing the following command:
```bash
$ kubectl exec -n kube-system nginx-ingress-controller-6fc5bcc8c9-chkxf -- cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
This will display the NGINX configuration, which should include the custom location block you defined.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","official document: !!!

### Explanation:
1. **Localization**: The issue arises from the use of the `configuration-snippet` annotation, which is not correctly placed within the context of the Ingress resource.
2. **Reasoning**: The `location` directive in the `configuration-snippet` is not being recognized properly because it is outside the defined location block of the Ingress resource.
3. **Remediation**: Ensure that the `pathType` is specified as `Prefix` in the paths section, and confirm that the `backend` service reference is correctly formatted.
4. **Validation**: The YAML syntax is corrected, and the Kubernetes schema is validated to ensure proper functioning of the Ingress resource.","```yaml

### Explanation:
1. **Configuration Snippet Placement**: The `configuration-snippet` annotation is intended to add custom NGINX configuration, but it must be used correctly within the context of the Ingress resource. Ensure that the snippet does not conflict with the defined paths.
2. **Path Definition**: The path is defined with `pathType: Prefix`, which is appropriate for matching requests that start with `/base/path`. This allows the Ingress to route traffic correctly to the specified backend service.
3. **Backend Service**: The backend service `myapi` is referenced correctly, ensuring that traffic is directed to the appropriate service on port 8080.
4. **Validation**: Ensure that the Ingress resource is validated against the Kubernetes API to confirm that the configuration is syntactically correct and adheres to the expected schema. 

If you encounter issues with the `configuration-snippet`, consider reviewing the NGINX Ingress Controller documentation for specific usage guidelines and examples.","3397.0, 3417.0, 3401.0"

### Explanation
I have found the solution. The new definitions for the PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) are provided above. After implementing these changes, the binding process worked as expected. 

You can verify the status of the PVC and PV using the following commands:

```bash
$ kubectl get pvc
NAME      STATUS   VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
nfs-pvc   Bound    nfs-pv   2Gi        RWO                           8s

$ kubectl get pv
NAME      CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM             STORAGECLASS   REASON    AGE
nfs-pv    2Gi       RWO           Retain            Bound    default/nfs-pvc                  22m
```

I hope this information proves helpful.","the next step is to create a persistentvolumeclaim.
pods use persistentvolumeclaims to request physical storage.
in this exercise, you create a persistentvolumeclaim that requests a volume of at least three gibibytes that can provide read-write access for at most one node at a time.
here is the configuration file for the persistentvolumeclaim: pods/storage/pv-claim.yaml

      storage: 3gi

create the persistentvolumeclaim:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/pv-claim.yaml

after you create the persistentvolumeclaim, the kubernetes control plane looks for a persistentvolume that satisfies the claim's requirements.
if the control plane finds a suitable persistentvolume with the same storageclass, it binds the claim to the volume.
look again at the persistentvolume:

kubectl get pv task-pv-volume

now the output shows a status of bound.

look at the persistentvolumeclaim:

kubectl get pvc task-pv-claim

the output shows that the persistentvolumeclaim is bound to your persistentvolume, task-pv-volume.

volume mode feature state:

kubernetes v1.18 [stable]

kubernetes supports two volumemodes of persistentvolumes: filesystem and block.
volumemode is an optional api parameter.
filesystem is the default mode used when volumemode parameter is omitted.
a volume with volumemode: filesystem is mounted into pods into a directory.
if the volume is backed by a block device and the device is empty, kubernetes creates a filesystem on the device before mounting it for the first time.
you can set the value of volumemode to block to use a volume as a raw block device.
such volume is presented into a pod as a block device, without any filesystem on it.
this mode is useful to provide a pod the fastest possible way to access a volume, without any filesystem layer between the pod and the volume.
on the other hand, the application running in the pod must know how to handle a raw block device.
see raw block volume support  for an example on how to use a volume with volumemode: block in a pod.
access modes a persistentvolume can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the resource provider.
as shown in the table below, providers will have different capabilities and each pv's access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume.
for example, nfs can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific nfs pv might be exported on the server as read-only.
each pv gets its own set of access modes describing that specific pv's capabilities.
the access modes are: readwriteonce the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
readwriteonce access mode still can allow multiple pods to access (read from or write to) that volume when the pods are running on the same node.
for single pod access, please see readwriteoncepod.
readonlymany the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
readwritemany the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

### Explanation
There is a dedicated transformer known as the images transformer for this purpose. You can maintain your deployment configuration as it is, whether or not you include a tag. In your kustomization file, you would specify the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - deployment.yaml

images:
  - name: nginx
    newTag: mynewtag
```

Please note that this will update the tag for all nginx images across all resources defined in your kustomization file. If you need to deploy multiple versions of nginx, consider using a placeholder for the image name in your deployment and create different entries in the transformer for each version.","kustomize is a tool for customizing kubernetes configurations.
it has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.
the source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:
  - .env
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

kubectl supports several update operations, each of which is applicable to different scenarios.
you can run multiple copies of your app, and use a rollout to gradually shift the traffic to new healthy pods.
eventually, all the running pods would have the new software.
this section of the page guides you through how to create and update applications with deployments.
let's say you were running version 1.14.2 of nginx:

kubectl create deployment my-nginx --image=nginx:1.14.2



deployment.apps/my-nginx created

ensure that there is 1 replica:

kubectl scale --replicas 1 deployments/my-nginx --subresource='scale' --type='merge' -p '{""spec"":{""replicas"": 1}}'



deployment.apps/my-nginx scaled

and allow kubernetes to add more temporary replicas during a rollout, by setting a surge maximum of 100%:

kubectl patch --type='merge' -p '{""spec"":{""strategy"":{""rollingupdate"":{""maxsurge"": ""100%"" }}}}'

that's it! the deployment will declaratively update the deployed nginx application progressively behind the scene.
it ensures that only a certain number of old replicas may be down while they are being updated, and only a certain number of new replicas may be created above the desired number of pods.
to learn more details about how this happens, visit deployment .
you can use rollouts with daemonsets, deployments, or statefulsets.
managing rollouts you can use kubectl rollout  to manage a progressive update of an existing application.
for example:

kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml

# wait for rollout to finish
kubectl rollout status deployment/my-deployment --timeout 10m # 10 minute timeout

or

kubectl apply -f backing-stateful-component.yaml

========================================","kustomize is a tool for customizing kubernetes configurations.
it has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.
the source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:
  - .env
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

### Explanation
I discovered that starting from nginx version 0.22.0, it is necessary to use capture groups to extract any substrings from the request URI. In earlier versions, simply using `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /` would suffice for any substring. However, this is no longer the case. Therefore, I updated my Ingress configuration to include the capture group in the rewrite target. The Ingress resource is defined under `networking.k8s.io/v1`, and it specifies the rules for routing traffic to the appropriate backend service based on the defined paths and host.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","official document: !!! attention     when using this annotation with the nginx annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity` of type `cookie`,  `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-path` must be also set; session cookie paths do not support regex.  using the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex` annotation will indicate whether or not the paths defined on an ingress use regular expressions.  the default value is `false`.  the following will indicate that regular expression paths are being used: ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true"" ```  the following will indicate that regular expression paths are __not__ being used: ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""false"" ```  when this annotation is set to `true`, the case insensitive regular expression [location modifier](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) will be enforced on all paths for a given host regardless of what ingress they are defined on.  additionally, if the [`rewrite-target` annotation](#rewrite) is used on any ingress for a given host, then the case insensitive regular expression [location modifier](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location) will be enforced on all paths for a given host regardless of what ingress they are defined on.  please read about [ingress path matching](../ingress-path-matching.md) before using this modifier. medium website: first, please consider enhancing your application so that it doesnt require session affinity! the problem if you absolutely must move forward with session affinity using ingress-nginx controller, you may find that it doesnt work initially. consider the following ingress object apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata name helloworld-deployment-ingress annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target 1 nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex true nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioaffinity cookie spec ingressclassname myingressclass rules - http paths - path helloworld. pathtype prefix backend service name helloworld-deployment-svc port number 8080 when this ingress is accessed, your first request is handled by one pod hello, world!

### Explanation
A StatefulSet automatically creates a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) for each pod, so you don't need to create one manually. Each PersistentVolume (PV) and PVC will bind exclusively to one another. If your PVC is already bound to a volume, any PVCs created by the StatefulSet won't be able to bind to that volume, rendering it unused.

In your scenario, the provided PersistentVolume and StatefulSet configurations should work effectively. Ensure that you delete any manually created PersistentVolumeClaim to avoid binding conflicts with your PersistentVolume. Additionally, verify that the storage class name is correctly set in both the PersistentVolume and the volumeClaimTemplates section of the StatefulSet; otherwise, the PVC created by the StatefulSet may fail to bind to your volume.","the example below demonstrates the components of a statefulset.

note: this example uses the readwriteonce access mode, for simplicity.
for production use, the kubernetes project recommends using the readwriteoncepod access mode instead.
in the above example: a headless service, named nginx, is used to control the network domain.
the statefulset, named web, has a spec that indicates that 3 replicas of the nginx container will be launched in unique pods.
the volumeclaimtemplates will provide stable storage using persistentvolumes  provisioned by a persistentvolume provisioner.
the name of a statefulset object must be a valid dns label .
pod selector you must set the

.spec.selector

field of a statefulset to match the labels of its

.spec.template.metadata.labels

.
failing to specify a matching pod selector will result in a validation error during statefulset creation.
volume claim templates you can set the

.spec.volumeclaimtemplates

field to create a persistentvolumeclaim .
this will provide stable storage to the statefulset if either the storageclass specified for the volume claim is set up to use dynamic provisioning , or the cluster already contains a persistentvolume with the correct storageclass and sufficient available storage space.
minimum ready seconds feature state:

kubernetes v1.25 [stable]



.spec.minreadyseconds

is an optional field that specifies the minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be running and ready without any of its containers crashing, for it to be considered available.
this is used to check progression of a rollout when using a rolling update  strategy.
this field defaults to 0 (the pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready).
to learn more about when a pod is considered ready, see container probes .
========================================","feature state:

kubernetes v1.32 [stable]

(enabled by default: true) the optional

.spec.persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy

field controls if and how pvcs are deleted during the lifecycle of a statefulset.
you must enable the statefulsetautodeletepvc feature gate  on the api server and the controller manager to use this field.
once enabled, there are two policies you can configure for each statefulset: whendeleted configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the statefulset is deleted whenscaled configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the replica count of the statefulset is reduced; for example, when scaling down the set.
for each policy that you can configure, you can set the value to either delete or retain.
delete the pvcs created from the statefulset volumeclaimtemplate are deleted for each pod affected by the policy.
with the whendeleted policy all pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are deleted after their pods have been deleted.
with the whenscaled policy, only pvcs corresponding to pod replicas being scaled down are deleted, after their pods have been deleted.
retain (default) pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are not affected when their pod is deleted.
this is the behavior before this new feature.
bear in mind that these policies only apply when pods are being removed due to the statefulset being deleted or scaled down.
for example, if a pod associated with a statefulset fails due to node failure, and the control plane creates a replacement pod, the statefulset retains the existing pvc.
the existing volume is unaffected, and the cluster will attach it to the node where the new pod is about to launch.
the default for policies is retain, matching the statefulset behavior before this new feature.
here is an example policy.

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: statefulset
...
spec:
  persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy:
    whendeleted: retain
    whenscaled: delete
...

the statefulset controller  adds owner references  to its pvcs, which are then deleted by the garbage collector  after the pod is terminated.
this enables the pod to cleanly unmount all volumes before the pvcs are deleted (and before the backing pv and volume are deleted, depending on the retain policy).
when you set the whendeleted policy to delete, an owner reference to the statefulset instance is placed on all pvcs associated with that statefulset.
the whenscaled policy must delete pvcs only when a pod is scaled down, and not when a pod is deleted for another reason.
when reconciling, the statefulset controller compares its desired replica count to the actual pods present on the cluster.
any statefulset pod whose id greater than the replica count is condemned and marked for deletion.
if the whenscaled policy is delete, the condemned pods are first set as owners to the associated statefulset template pvcs, before the pod is deleted.
this causes the pvcs to be garbage collected after only the condemned pods have terminated.
this means that if the controller crashes and restarts, no pod will be deleted before its owner reference has been updated appropriate to the policy.
if a condemned pod is force-deleted while the controller is down, the owner reference may or may not have been set up, depending on when the controller crashed.
it may take several reconcile loops to update the owner references, so some condemned pods may have set up owner references and others may not.
for this reason we recommend waiting for the controller to come back up, which will verify owner references before terminating pods.
if that is not possible, the operator should verify the owner references on pvcs to ensure the expected objects are deleted when pods are force-deleted.
replicas

.spec.replicas

is an optional field that specifies the number of desired pods.
it defaults to 1.
should you manually scale a deployment, example via

kubectl scale statefulset statefulset --replicas=x

, and then you update that statefulset based on a manifest (for example: by running

kubectl apply -f statefu","you can run a stateful application by creating a kubernetes deployment and connecting it to an existing persistentvolume using a persistentvolumeclaim.
for example, this yaml file describes a deployment that runs mysql and references the persistentvolumeclaim.
the file defines a volume mount for /var/lib/mysql, and then creates a persistentvolumeclaim that looks for a 20g volume.
this claim is satisfied by any existing volume that meets the requirements, or by a dynamic provisioner.
note: the password is defined in the config yaml, and this is insecure.

      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1gi

note: this example uses the readwriteonce access mode, for simplicity.
for production use, the kubernetes project recommends using the readwriteoncepod access mode instead.
in the above example: a headless service, named nginx, is used to control the network domain.
the statefulset, named web, has a spec that indicates that 3 replicas of the nginx container will be launched in unique pods.
the volumeclaimtemplates will provide stable storage using persistentvolumes  provisioned by a persistentvolume provisioner.
the name of a statefulset object must be a valid dns label .
pod selector you must set the

.spec.selector

field of a statefulset to match the labels of its

.spec.template.metadata.labels

.
failing to specify a matching pod selector will result in a validation error during statefulset creation.
volume claim templates you can set the

.spec.volumeclaimtemplates

field to create a persistentvolumeclaim .
this will provide stable storage to the statefulset if either the storageclass specified for the volume claim is set up to use dynamic provisioning , or the cluster already contains a persistentvolume with the correct storageclass and sufficient available storage space.
minimum ready seconds feature state:

kubernetes v1.25 [stable]



.spec.minreadyseconds

is an optional field that specifies the minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be running and ready without any of its containers crashing, for it to be considered available.
this is used to check progression of a rollout when using a rolling update  strategy.
this field defaults to 0 (the pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready).
to learn more about when a pod is considered ready, see container probes .
======================================== feature state:

kubernetes v1.32 [stable]

(enabled by default: true) the optional

.spec.persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy

field controls if and how pvcs are deleted during the lifecycle of a statefulset.
you must enable the statefulsetautodeletepvc feature gate  on the api server and the controller manager to use this field.
once enabled, there are two policies you can configure for each statefulset: whendeleted configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the statefulset is deleted whenscaled configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the replica count of the statefulset is reduced; for example, when scaling down the set.
for each policy that you can configure, you can set the value to either delete or retain.
delete the pvcs created from the statefulset volumeclaimtemplate are deleted for each pod affected by the policy.
with the whendeleted policy all pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are deleted after their pods have been deleted.
with the whenscaled policy, only pvcs corresponding to pod replicas being scaled down are deleted, after their pods have been deleted.
retain (default) pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are not affected when their pod is deleted.
this is the behavior before this new feature.
bear in mind that these policies only apply when pods are being removed due to the statefulset being deleted or scaled down.
for example, if a pod associated with a statefulset fails due to node failure, and the control plane creates a replacement pod, the statefulset retains the existing pvc.
the existing volume is unaffected, and the cluster will attach it to the node where the new pod is about to launch.
the default for policies is retain, matching the statefulset behavior before this new feature.
here is an example policy.

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: statefulset
...
spec:
  persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy:
    whendeleted: retain
    whenscaled: delete
...

the statefulset controller  adds owner references  to its pvcs, which are then deleted by the garbage collector  after the pod is terminated.
this enables the pod to cleanly unmount all volumes before the pvcs are deleted (and before the backing pv and volume are deleted, depending on the retain policy).
when you set the whendeleted policy to delete, an owner reference to the statefulset instance is placed on all pvcs associated with that statefulset.
the whenscaled policy must delete pvcs only when a pod is scaled down, and not when a pod is deleted for another reason.
when reconciling, the statefulset controller compares its desired replica count to the actual pods present on the cluster.
any statefulset pod whose id greater than the replica count is condemned and marked for deletion.
if the whenscaled policy is delete, the condemned pods are first set as owners to the associated statefulset template pvcs, before the pod is deleted.
this causes the pvcs to be garbage collected after only the condemned pods have terminated.
this means that if the controller crashes and restarts, no pod will be deleted before its owner reference has been updated appropriate to the policy.
if a condemned pod is force-deleted while the controller is down, the owner reference may or may not have been set up, depending on when the controller crashed.
it may take several reconcile loops to update the owner references, so some condemned pods may have set up owner references and others may not.
for this reason we recommend waiting for the controller to come back up, which will verify owner references before terminating pods.
if that is not possible, the operator should verify the owner references on pvcs to ensure the expected objects are deleted when pods are force-deleted.
replicas

.spec.replicas

is an optional field that specifies the number of desired pods.
it defaults to 1.
should you manually scale a deployment, example via

kubectl scale statefulset statefulset --replicas=x

, and then you update that statefulset based on a manifest (for example: by running

kubectl apply -f statefu you can run a stateful application by creating a kubernetes deployment and connecting it to an existing persistentvolume using a persistentvolumeclaim.
for example, this yaml file describes a deployment that runs mysql and references the persistentvolumeclaim.
the file defines a volume mount for /var/lib/mysql, and then creates a persistentvolumeclaim that looks for a 20g volume.
this claim is satisfied by any existing volume that meets the requirements, or by a dynamic provisioner.
note: the password is defined in the config yaml, and this is insecure.
see kubernetes secrets  for a secure solution.

### Explanation
To grant the default service account view permissions, you need to create a role binding. This role binding will associate the default service account with the `view` ClusterRole, allowing it to access resources in the cluster. The `ClusterRoleBinding` is defined with the necessary metadata and references the appropriate role and subject.","in this section, you apply the following pod security standards to the latest version: baseline standard in enforce mode.
restricted standard in warn and audit mode.
the baseline pod security standard provides a convenient middle ground that allows keeping the exemption list short and prevents known privilege escalations.
additionally, to prevent pods from failing in kube-system, you'll exempt the namespace from having pod security standards applied.
when you implement pod security admission in your own environment, consider the following: based on the risk posture applied to a cluster, a stricter pod security standard like restricted might be a better choice.
exempting the kube-system namespace allows pods to run as privileged in this namespace.
for real world use, the kubernetes project strongly recommends that you apply strict rbac policies that limit access to kube-system, following the principle of least privilege.
to implement the preceding standards, do the following: create a configuration file that can be consumed by the pod security admission controller to implement these pod security standards:

to further debug and diagnose cluster proble","least privilege ideally, minimal rbac rights should be assigned to users and service accounts.
only permissions explicitly required for their operation should be used.
while each cluster will be different, some general rules that can be applied are : assign permissions at the namespace level where possible.
use rolebindings as opposed to clusterrolebindings to give users rights only within a specific namespace.
avoid providing wildcard permissions when possible, especially to all resources.
as kubernetes is an extensible system, providing wildcard access gives rights not just to all object types that currently exist in the cluster, but also to all object types which are created in the future.
administrators should not use cluster-admin accounts except where specifically needed.
providing a low privileged account with impersonation rights  can avoid accidental modification of cluster resources.
avoid adding users to the system:masters group.
any user who is a member of this group bypasses all rbac rights checks and will always have unrestricted superuser access, which cannot be revoked by removing rolebindings or clusterrolebindings.
as an aside, if a cluster is using an authorization webhook, membership of this group also bypasses that webhook (requests from users who are members of that group are never sent to the webhook) minimize distribution of privileged tokens ideally, pods shouldn't be assigned service accounts that have been granted powerful permissions (for example, any of the rights listed under privilege escalation risks ).
in cases where a workload requires powerful permissions, consider the following practices: limit the number of nodes running powerful pods.
ensure that any daemonsets you run are necessary and are run with least privilege to limit the blast radius of container escapes.
avoid running powerful pods alongside untrusted or publicly-exposed ones.
consider using taints and toleration , nodeaffinity , or podantiaffinity  to ensure pods don't run alongside untrusted or less-trusted pods.
pay special attention to situations where less-trustworthy pods are not meeting the restricted pod security standard.
hardening kubernetes defaults to providing access which may not be required in every cluster.
reviewing the rbac rights provided by default can provide opportunities for security hardening.
in general, changes should not be made to rights provided to system: accounts some options to harden cluster rights exist: review bindings for the system:unauthenticated group and remove them where possible, as this gives access to anyone who can contact the api server at a network level.
avoid the default auto-mounting of service account tokens by setting automountserviceaccounttoken: false.
for more details, see using default service account token .
setting this value for a pod will overwrite the service account setting, workloads which require service account tokens can still mount them.
periodic review it is vital to periodically review the kubernetes rbac settings for redundant entries and possible privilege escalations.
if an attacker is able to create a user account with the same name as a deleted user, they can automatically inherit all the rights of the deleted user, especially the rights assigned to that user.
========================================","within kubernetes rbac there are a number of privileges which, if granted, can allow a user or a service account to escalate their privileges in the cluster or affect systems outside the cluster.
this section is intended to provide visibility of the areas where cluster operators should take care, to ensure that they do not inadvertently allow for more access to clusters than intended.
listing secrets it is generally clear that allowing get access on secrets will allow a user to read their contents.
it is also important to note that list and watch access also effectively allow for users to reveal the secret contents.
for example, when a list response is returned (for example, via

kubectl get secrets -a -o yaml

), the response includes the contents of all secrets.
workload creation permission to create workloads (either pods, or workload resources  that manage pods) in a namespace implicitly grants access to many other resources in that namespace, such as secrets, configmaps, and persistentvolumes that can be mounted in pods.
additionally, since pods can run as any serviceaccount , granting permission to create workloads also implicitly grants the api access levels of any service account in that namespace.
users who can run privileged pods can use that access to gain node access and potentially to further elevate their privileges.
where you do not fully trust a user or other principal with the ability to create suitably secure and isolated pods, you should enforce either the baseline or restricted pod security standard.
you can use pod security admission  or other (third party) mechanisms to implement that enforcement.
for these reasons, namespaces should be used to separate resources requiring different levels of trust or tenancy.
it is still considered best practice to follow least privilege  principles and assign the minimum set of permissions, but boundaries within a namespace should be considered weak.
persistent volume creation if someone - or some application - is allowed to create arbitrary persistentvolumes, that access includes the creation of hostpath volumes, which then means that a pod would get access to the underlying host filesystem(s) on the associated node.
granting that ability is a security risk.
there are many ways a container with unrestricted access to the host filesystem can escalate privileges, including reading data from other containers, and abusing the credentials of system services, such as kubelet.
you should only allow access to create persistentvolume objects for: users (cluster operators) that need this access for their work, and who you trust.
the kubernetes control plane components which creates persistentvolumes based on persistentvolumeclaims that are configured for automatic provisioning.
this is usually setup by the kubernetes provider or by the operator when installing a csi driver.
where access to persistent storage is required trusted administrators should create persistentvolumes, and constrained users should use persistentvolumeclaims to access that storage.
access to proxy subresource of nodes users with access to the proxy sub-resource of node objects have rights to the kubelet api, which allows for command execution on every pod on the node(s) to which they have rights.
this access bypasses audit logging and admission control, so care should be taken before granting rights to this resource.
escalate verb generally, the rbac system prevents users from creating clusterroles with more rights than the user possesses.
the exception to this is the escalate verb.
as noted in the rbac documentation , users with this right can effectively escalate their privileges.
bind verb similar to the escalate verb, granting users this right allows for the bypass of kubernetes in-built protections against privilege escalation, allowing users to create bindings to roles with rights they do not already have.
impersonate verb this verb allows users to impersonate and gain the rights of other users in the cluster.
care should be taken when granting it, to ensure that ex","in this section, you apply the following pod security standards to the latest version: baseline standard in enforce mode.
restricted standard in warn and audit mode.
the baseline pod security standard provides a convenient middle ground that allows keeping the exemption list short and prevents known privilege escalations.
additionally, to prevent pods from failing in kube-system, you'll exempt the namespace from having pod security standards applied.
when you implement pod security admission in your own environment, consider the following: based on the risk posture applied to a cluster, a stricter pod security standard like restricted might be a better choice.
exempting the kube-system namespace allows pods to run as privileged in this namespace.
for real world use, the kubernetes project strongly recommends that you apply strict rbac policies that limit access to kube-system, following the principle of least privilege.
to implement the preceding standards, do the following: create a configuration file that can be consumed by the pod security admission controller to implement these pod security standards:

mkdir -p /tmp/pss

### Explanation
To create a pod in Kubernetes, you can use the `curl` command as follows:

```bash
curl -k -v -X POST -H ""Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>"" -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods -d @nginx-pod.json
```

Make sure that the token you are using has the necessary permissions to create a pod. If anyone knows a method to achieve this without converting the YAML to JSON, please share your insights.","in this exercise you create a pod that has one application container and one init container.
the init container runs to completion before the application container starts.
here is the configuration file for the pod: pods/init-containers.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: init-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerport: 80
    volumemounts:
    - name: workdir
      mountpath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  # these containers are run during pod initialization
  initcontainers:
  - name: install
    image: busybox:1.28
    command:
    - wget
    - ""-o""
    - ""/work-dir/index.html""
    - http://info.cern.ch
    volumemounts:
    - name: workdir
      mountpath: ""/work-dir""
  dnspolicy: default
  volumes:
  - name: workdir
    emptydir: {}

in the configuration file, you can see that the pod has a volume that the init container and the application container share.
the init container mounts the shared volume at /work-dir, and the application container mounts the shared volume at /usr/share/nginx/html.
the init container runs the following command and then terminates:

wget -o /work-dir/index.html http://info.cern.ch

notice that the init container writes the

index.html

file in the root directory of the nginx server.
create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/init-containers.yaml

verify that the nginx container is running:

kubectl get pod init-demo

the output shows that the nginx container is running:

name        ready     status    restarts   age
init-demo   1/1       running   0          1m

get a shell into the nginx container running in the init-demo pod:

kubectl exec -it init-demo -- /bin/bash

in your shell, send a get request to the nginx server:

root@nginx:~# apt-get update
root@nginx:~# apt-get install curl
root@nginx:~# curl localhost

the output shows that nginx is serving the web page that was written by the init container:

&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;header&gt;
&lt;title&gt;http://info.cern.ch&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;http://info.cern.ch - home of the first website&lt;/h1&gt;
  ...

use the configuration file to create a pod that will get scheduled on your chosen node:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/pod-nginx.yaml

verify that the pod is running on your chosen node:

kubectl get pods --output=wide

the output is similar to this:

the init container runs to completion before the application container starts.
here is the configuration file for the pod: pods/init-containers.yaml

      mountpath: ""/work-dir""
  dnspolicy: default
  volumes:
  - name: workdir

in the configuration file, you can see that the pod has a volume that the init container and the application container share.
the init container mounts the shared volume at /work-dir, and the application container mounts the shared volume at /usr/share/nginx/html.
the init container runs the following command and then terminates:

wget -o /work-dir/index.html http://info.cern.ch

notice that the init container writes the

index.html

file in the root directory of the nginx server.
create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/init-containers.yaml

verify that the nginx container is running:

kubectl get pod init-demo

the output shows that the nginx container is running:

name        ready     status    restarts   age
init-demo   1/1       running   0          1m

get a shell into the nginx container running in the init-demo pod:

kubectl exec -it init-demo -- /bin/bash

in your shell, send a get request to the nginx server:

root@nginx:~# apt-get update
root@nginx:~# apt-get install curl
root@nginx:~# curl localhost

the output shows that nginx is serving the web page that was written by the init container:

&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;header&gt;
&lt;title&gt;http://info.cern.ch&lt;/title&gt;

The issue was due to using the incorrect API version (`apps/v1`) and incorrect casing for `CronJob` and `jobTemplate`. The correct API version for CronJobs is `batch/v1`, and the fields should be properly cased.","```yaml

The previous response correctly identifies that the issue was due to using the incorrect API version (`apps/v1`) and incorrect casing for `CronJob` and `jobTemplate`. The correct API version for CronJobs is indeed `batch/v1`, and the fields should be properly cased to align with Kubernetes specifications.

    The user is attempting to deploy a highly available (HA) Keycloak cluster with two nodes on Kubernetes (GKE) but is facing issues with pod discovery. The Keycloak pods can initiate and the service is operational, yet they fail to recognize each other. The user has tried both the `kubernetes.kube_ping` and `dns.dns_ping` discovery protocols, encountering various issues including a 403 authorization error with the Kubernetes downward API and login failures when using the DNS discovery method. The user seeks guidance on resolving these discovery issues to achieve a functional HA Keycloak setup.

```

### Explanation
In Keycloak versions 17 and later, the default discovery mechanism for JGroups (the underlying clustering technology) is set to `dns_ping`, but it must be explicitly enabled. To do this, you need to create a headless service that points to your Keycloak pods (a headless service is a standard service with `clusterIP: None`). Additionally, you should set the environment variable `KC_CACHE_STACK` to `kubernetes` to activate the Kubernetes JGroups configurations, and use `JAVA_OPTS_APPEND` to specify how to locate the other Keycloak pods via DNS.

When Keycloak starts, JGroups will perform a DNS query for the headless service (for example, `keycloak-headless.my_namespace.svc.cluster.local`), which will return the IP addresses of all pods associated with that service. JGroups will then connect to each IP on the communication port to establish the cluster.

**Update (2022-08-01):** The configuration provided above is for Keycloak versions up to 16. Starting from version 17, Keycloak has transitioned to the Quarkus distribution, which requires a different configuration approach. 

For Keycloak versions up to 16, the `kube_ping` mechanism operates similarly to executing `kubectl get pods` within a Keycloak pod to discover the IPs of other Keycloak pods. However, instead of using `kubectl`, Keycloak queries the Kubernetes API directly, which necessitates access credentials in the form of an access token. 

To securely provide this token, you can create a service account, assign it the necessary permissions through a role binding, and specify that account in the pod configuration. The token will be mounted as a file at a predetermined location, which is expected by all Kubernetes clients. When the client needs to call the API, it retrieves the token from that location.

If you lack the permissions to create role bindings, you can request an administrator to set up the service account and role binding for you, or you can pass your own user's token (if you have the necessary permissions) using the `sa_token_file` environment variable. This file can be created using a secret or config map, mounted to the pod, and the `sa_token_file` variable can be set to the file's location. Note that this method is specific to the JGroups library used by Keycloak.

If you have the necessary permissions to create service accounts and role bindings in the cluster, you can follow the example below (not tested):

```bash
export TARGET_NAMESPACE=default

# Create a service account
kubectl create serviceaccount keycloak-kubeping-service-account -n $TARGET_NAMESPACE

# Define the role and role binding
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
kind: Role

metadata:
  name: keycloak-kubeping-pod-reader

  kind: Role
  name: keycloak-kubeping-pod-reader
subjects:

  name: keycloak-kubeping-service-account
  namespace: $TARGET_NAMESPACE
EOF
```

In your deployment configuration, specify the service account:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: keycloak
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: keycloak-kubeping-service-account
      containers:
      - name: keycloak
        image: jboss/keycloak
        env:
          - name: JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL
            value: kubernetes.kube_ping
          - name: JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES
            value: dump_requests=true
          - name: KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                apiVersion: v1
                fieldPath: metadata.namespace
```

Setting `dump_requests=true` can help with debugging Kubernetes requests, but it's advisable to set it to false in production. You can also use `namespace=<your_namespace>` instead of `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE`, but the latter allows the pod to automatically detect the namespace in which it is running. Keep in mind that `kube_ping` will discover all pods in the namespace, not just Keycloak pods, and will attempt to connect to all of them. If other pods are not affected by this, it should be fine.","the guestbook application uses redis to store its data.
creating the redis deployment the manifest file, included below, specifies a deployment controller that runs a single replica redis pod.

creating the redis leader service the guestbook application needs to communicate to the redis to write its data.
you need to apply a service  to proxy the traffic to the redis pod.

the response should be similar to this:

name  ","the first step in troubleshooting is triage.
what is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.
check the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:

kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}

look at the state of the containers in the pod.
are they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.
my pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.
generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.
look at the output of the

kubectl describe ...

command above.
there should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.
reasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
see compute resources document  for more information.
you are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.
in most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.
if you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.
my pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.
again, the information from

kubectl describe ...

should be informative.
the most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.
there are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
have you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.
for example, if you use docker on your pc, run

docker pull &lt;image&gt;

.
my pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.
this typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.
to identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.
if the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.
disable the webhook for update operations.
report an issue with the corresponding provider.
if you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.
for example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.
for a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.
in other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.
this allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.
my pod is crashing or otherwise unhealthy once your pod has been scheduled, the methods described in debug running pods  are available for debugging.
my pod is running but not doing what i told it to do if your pod is not behaving as you expected, it may be that there was an error in your pod description (e.g.

mypod.yaml

file on your local machine), and that the error was silently ignored when you created the pod.
often a section of the pod description is nested incorrectly, or a key name is typed incorrectly, and so the key is ignored.
for example, if you misspelled command as commnd then the pod will be created but will not use the command line you intended it to use.
the first thing to do is to delete your pod and try creating it again with the --validate option.
for example, run

kubectl apply --va","for the purposes of this walk-through, let's run some pods.
since you're probably debugging your own service you can substitute your own details, or you can follow along and get a second data point.

kubectl create deployment hostnames --image=registry.k8s.io/serve_hostname



deployment.apps/hostnames created

kubectl commands will print the type and name of the resource created or mutated, which can then be used in subsequent commands.
let's scale the deployment to 3 replicas.

kubectl scale deployment hostnames --replicas=3



deployment.apps/hostnames scaled

note that this is the same as if you had started the deployment with the following yaml:

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hostnames
  name: hostnames
spec:
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: hostnames
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hostnames
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hostnames
        image: registry.k8s.io/serve_hostname

the label ""app"" is automatically set by

kubectl create deployment

to the name of the deployment.
you can confirm your pods are running:

kubectl get pods -l app=hostnames



name                        ready     status    restarts   age
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw   1/1       running   0          2m
hostnames-632524106-ly40y   1/1       running   0          2m
hostnames-632524106-tlaok   1/1       running   0          2m

you can also confirm that your pods are serving.
you can get the list of pod ip addresses and test them directly.

kubectl get pods -l app=hostnames \
    -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{.status.podip}}{{""\n""}}{{end}}'



10.244.0.5
10.244.0.6
10.244.0.7

the example container used for this walk-through serves its own hostname via http on port 9376, but if you are debugging your own app, you'll want to use whatever port number your pods are listening on.
from within a pod:

for ep in 10.244.0.5:9376 10.244.0.6:9376 10.244.0.7:9376; do
    wget -qo- $ep
done

this should produce something like:

hostnames-632524106-bbpiw
hostnames-632524106-ly40y

if you are not getting the responses you expect at this point, your pods might not be healthy or might not be listening on the port you think they are.
you might find kubectl logs to be useful for seeing what is happening, or perhaps you need to kubectl exec directly into your pods and debug from there.
assuming everything has gone to plan so far, you can start to investigate why your service doesn't work.

creating the redis leader service the guestbook application needs to communicate to the redis to write its data.
you need to apply a service  to proxy the traffic to the redis pod.

note: this manifest file creates a service named redis-leader with a set of labels that match the labels previously defined, so the service routes network traffic to the redis pod.
set up redis followers although the redis leader is a single pod, you can make it highly available and meet traffic demands by adding a few redis followers, or replicas.

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/redis-follower-deployment.yaml

kubectl get pods

the response should be similar to this:

name   the first step in troubleshooting is triage.
what is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.
check the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:

kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}

look at the state of the containers in the pod.
are they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.
my pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.
generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.
look at the output of the

kubectl describe ...

command above.
there should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.
reasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
see compute resources document  for more information.
you are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.
in most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.
if you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.
my pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.
again, the information from

kubectl describe ...

should be informative.
the most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.
there are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
have you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.
for example, if you use docker on your pc, run

docker pull &lt;image&gt;

.
my pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.
this typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.
to identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.
if the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.
disable the webhook for update operations.
report an issue with the corresponding provider.
if you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.
for example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.
for a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.
in other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.
this allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.
my pod is crashing or otherwise unhealthy once your pod has been scheduled, the methods described in debug running pods  are available for debugging.
my pod is running but not doing what i told it to do if your pod is not behaving as you expected, it may be that there was an error in your pod description (e.g.

mypod.yaml

file on your local machine), and that the error was silently ignored when you created the pod.
often a section of the pod description is nested incorrectly, or a key name is typed incorrectly, and so the key is ignored.
for example, if you misspelled command as commnd then the pod will be created but will not use the command line you intended it to use.
the first thing to do is to delete your pod and try creating it again with the --validate option.
for example, run

kubectl apply --va for the purposes of this walk-through, let's run some pods.
since you're probably debugging your own service you can substitute your own details, or you can follow along and get a second data point.

kubectl create deployment hostnames --image=registry.k8s.io/serve_hostname



deployment.apps/hostnames created

kubectl commands will print the type and name of the resource created or mutated, which can then be used in subsequent commands.
let's scale the deployment to 3 replicas.

kubectl scale deployment hostnames --replicas=3



deployment.apps/hostnames scaled

note that this is the same as if you had started the deployment with the following yaml:

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hostnames
  name: hostnames
spec:
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: hostnames
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hostnames
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hostnames
        image: registry.k8s.io/serve_hostname

the label ""app"" is automatically set by

kubectl create deployment

to the name of the deployment.
you can confirm your pods are running:

kubectl get pods -l app=hostnames



name                        ready     status    restarts   age
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw   1/1       running   0          2m
hostnames-632524106-ly40y   1/1       running   0          2m
hostnames-632524106-tlaok   1/1       running   0          2m

you can also confirm that your pods are serving.
you can get the list of pod ip addresses and test them directly.

kubectl get pods -l app=hostnames \
    -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{.status.podip}}{{""\n""}}{{end}}'



10.244.0.5
10.244.0.6
10.244.0.7

the example container used for this walk-through serves its own hostname via http on port 9376, but if you are debugging your own app, you'll want to use whatever port number your pods are listening on.
from within a pod:

for ep in 10.244.0.5:9376 10.244.0.6:9376 10.244.0.7:9376; do
    wget -qo- $ep
done

this should produce something like:

hostnames-632524106-bbpiw
hostnames-632524106-ly40y
hostnames-632524106-tlaok

if you are not getting the responses you expect at this point, your pods might not be healthy or might not be listening on the port you think they are.
you might find kubectl logs to be useful for seeing what is happening, or perhaps you need to kubectl exec directly into your pods and debug from there.
assuming everything has gone to plan so far, you can start to investigate why your service doesn't work.

### Explanation
The configuration of your NGINX controller will determine how traffic is managed. You need to set up a service that acts as the entry point for external access, as detailed in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#what-is-ingress). Essentially, the flow of traffic is as follows: ingress -> services -> pods. 

Since you are not using AWS or Google Cloud, you will need to utilize either `externalIP` or `NodePort` and configure the service accordingly. Additionally, DNS management is necessary for your domain resolution. For local testing, you can modify your `/etc/hosts` file. 

In cloud environments like AWS or Google Cloud, you would typically create a service of type `LoadBalancer` and direct your DNS records to the load balancer's address (using CNAME for AWS and the IP address for Google).","official document: in some scenarios the exposed url in the backend service differs from the specified path in the ingress rule. without a rewrite any request will return 404. set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` to the path expected by the service.  if the application root is exposed in a different path and needs to be redirected, set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root` to redirect requests for `/`.  !!! example     please check the [rewrite](../../examples/rewrite/readme.md) example. github pages: this example demonstrates how to use rewrite annotations. prerequisites you will need to make sure your ingress targets exactly one ingress controller by specifying the ingress.class annotation, and that you have an ingress controller running in your cluster. deployment rewriting can be controlled using the following annotations name description values nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target target uri where the traffic must be redirected string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iossl-redirect indicates if the location section is only accessible via ssl defaults to true when ingress contains a certificate bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioforce-ssl-redirect forces the redirection to https even if the ingress is not tls enabled bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root defines the application root that the controller must redirect if its in context string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex indicates if the paths defined on an ingress use regular expressions bool. create an ingress rule with a rewrite annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex true nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target 2 name rewrite namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host rewrite.bar.com http paths - path something. pathtype implementationspecific backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - in this ingress definition, any characters captured by . will be assigned to the placeholder 2, which is then used as a parameter in the rewrite-target annotation. for example, the ingress definition above will result in the following rewrites rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomethingnew rewrites to rewrite.bar.comnew app root create an ingress rule with an app-root annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root app1 name approot namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host approot.bar.com http paths - path pathtype prefix backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - check the rewrite is working curl -i -k httpapproot.bar.com http1.1 302 moved temporarily server nginx1.11.10 date mon, 13 mar 2017 145715 gmt content-type texthtml content-length 162 location httpapproot.bar.comapp1 connection keep-alive. medium website: example 1 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target destination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one does a transparent reverse proxy. it does not update the location header so the url in the browser does not change. example 2 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target httpsnginx.redirectdestination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one changes the location header and the url in the browser is updated http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsource location httpsnginx.redirectdestination http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsourcebar location httpsnginx.redirectdestinationbar this is because the replacement string as specified in rewrite-target an","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.

### Explanation
If you are using a dependent chart, such as the nginx chart in your case, you need to organize the values for that subchart within its own block, labeled with the name of the dependency. Given that you have specified the dependency as nginx in your `Chart.yaml`, you should structure your `values.yaml` like this:

```yaml
nginx:
  namespaceOverride: airflow
  replicaCount: 2
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
```

If you were to use your `values.yaml` as it currently stands:

```yaml
namespaceOverride: airflow
replicaCount: 2
service:
  type: ClusterIP
```

This would only apply those values to your ""root"" chart, which would not be effective since it is empty.","helm chart templates are written in the
 go template
language , with the addition of 50 or so
add-on template functions
 from the sprig
library  and a few other
 specialized
functions .all template files are stored in a chart's  templates/  folder. when helm
renders the charts, it will pass every file in that directory through the
template engine.values for the templates are supplied two ways:chart developers may supply a file called  values.yaml  inside of a chart.
this file can contain default values. chart users may supply a yaml file that contains values. this can be provided
on the command line with  helm install .when a user supplies custom values, these values will override the values in the
chart's  values.yaml  file.template filestemplate files follow the standard conventions for writing go templates (see
 the text/template go package
documentation  for details). an example
template file might look something like this:apiversion :   v1

 go template
language , with the addition of 50 or so
add-on template functions
 from the sprig
library  and a few other
 specialized
functions .all template files are stored in a chart's  templates/  folder. when helm
renders the charts, it will pass every file in that directory through the
template engine.values for the templates are supplied two ways:chart developers may supply a file called  values.yaml  inside of a chart.
this file can contain default values. chart users may supply a yaml file that contains values. this can be provided
on the command line with  helm install .when a user supplies custom values, these values will override the values in the
chart's  values.yaml  file.template filestemplate files follow the standard conventions for writing go templates (see
 the text/template go package
documentation  for details). an example

### Explanation
This issue is recognized regarding the annotation for SSL redirection when used alongside the proxy protocol and SSL termination on ELB. A discussion about this was held on GitHub, and a solution was provided in that thread. Instead of using the `force-ssl-redirect` annotation, you should create a custom ConfigMap for the NGINX Ingress controller as shown above. This configuration will set up an additional listener that performs a simple redirection to HTTPS. After applying this ConfigMap to your Ingress controller, ensure to add NodePort 8080 to its container definition and the service. You can then direct port 80 of your ELB to port 8080 of the service. With this additional listener in place, the setup should function correctly.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","official document: by default the controller redirects 308 to https if tls is enabled for that ingress. if you want to disable this behavior globally, you can use ssl-redirect false in the nginx configmap.configmap.md#ssl-redirect. to configure this feature for specific ingress resources, you can use the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iossl-redirect false annotation in the particular resource. when using ssl offloading outside of cluster e.g. aws elb it may be useful to enforce a redirect to https even when there is no tls certificate available. this can be achieved by using the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioforce-ssl-redirect true annotation in the particular resource. to preserve the trailing slash in the uri with ssl-redirect, set nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iopreserve-trailing-slash true annotation for that particular resource.

**Explanation:** The ""too many redirects"" issue is likely caused by conflicting SSL redirection settings. By adding the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: ""false""`, you can prevent the Ingress from automatically redirecting HTTP to HTTPS, which can help avoid the redirect loop. Ensure that the `force-ssl-redirect` is set to true only when you want to enforce HTTPS.","```yaml

**Explanation:** The ""too many redirects"" issue is likely caused by conflicting SSL redirection settings. The annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: ""false""` prevents the Ingress from automatically redirecting HTTP to HTTPS, which can help avoid the redirect loop. Ensure that `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: ""true""` is only used when you want to enforce HTTPS. If you need to maintain both HTTP and HTTPS access, consider adjusting these annotations accordingly.","3397.0, 3407.0, 3404.0"

### Explanation
The final configuration that worked for me was based on the `extensions/v1beta1` API version, which is now deprecated. The `Ingress` resource has transitioned to `networking.k8s.io/v1`, and the previous field names have been updated. In this configuration, I included an annotation for rewriting the target and a server snippet to deny access to a specific path, returning a 403 status code. The backend service is defined with the new syntax, where `servicename` is replaced with `service.name` and `serviceport` with `service.port.number`. The path also requires an explicit `pathType` declaration.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","official document: using the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet` it is possible to add custom configuration in the server configuration block.  ```yaml apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: ingress metadata:   annotations:     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: |         set $agentflag 0;

1. **Localization**: The issue arises from the use of the `server-snippet` annotation, which is not being processed correctly due to the location block being outside the defined location context.
2. **Reasoning**: The `server-snippet` can only be used once per host and may lead to undesired behavior if not configured properly. The 500 error indicates that the location is not recognized within the context of the Ingress resource.
3. **Remediation**: Ensure that the `apiVersion` is updated to `networking.k8s.io/v1` and that the `pathType` is specified correctly. The `backend` service definition has also been updated to match the current schema.
4. **Validation**: The YAML syntax is corrected, and the Kubernetes schema is validated to ensure compatibility with the current version of Kubernetes.","```yaml

### Explanation
It appears that there is an issue with your PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). The status of your PVC shows that it is pending, and the associated PersistentVolume (PV) has not been created. This suggests a problem with your storage class. Specifically, it seems that the `gp2` storage class is not available in your cluster. If you are using AWS EKS, you can create the `gp2` storage class by applying the YAML file provided above. Alternatively, if you are on GCP GKE, you may want to change the storage class to `standard`.","feature state:

kubernetes v1.32 [stable]

(enabled by default: true) the optional

.spec.persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy

field controls if and how pvcs are deleted during the lifecycle of a statefulset.
you must enable the statefulsetautodeletepvc feature gate  on the api server and the controller manager to use this field.
once enabled, there are two policies you can configure for each statefulset: whendeleted configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the statefulset is deleted whenscaled configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the replica count of the statefulset is reduced; for example, when scaling down the set.
for each policy that you can configure, you can set the value to either delete or retain.
delete the pvcs created from the statefulset volumeclaimtemplate are deleted for each pod affected by the policy.
with the whendeleted policy all pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are deleted after their pods have been deleted.
with the whenscaled policy, only pvcs corresponding to pod replicas being scaled down are deleted, after their pods have been deleted.
retain (default) pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are not affected when their pod is deleted.
this is the behavior before this new feature.
bear in mind that these policies only apply when pods are being removed due to the statefulset being deleted or scaled down.
for example, if a pod associated with a statefulset fails due to node failure, and the control plane creates a replacement pod, the statefulset retains the existing pvc.
the existing volume is unaffected, and the cluster will attach it to the node where the new pod is about to launch.
the default for policies is retain, matching the statefulset behavior before this new feature.
here is an example policy.

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: statefulset
...
spec:
  persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy:
    whendeleted: retain
    whenscaled: delete
...

the statefulset controller  adds owner references  to its pvcs, which are then deleted by the garbage collector  after the pod is terminated.
this enables the pod to cleanly unmount all volumes before the pvcs are deleted (and before the backing pv and volume are deleted, depending on the retain policy).
when you set the whendeleted policy to delete, an owner reference to the statefulset instance is placed on all pvcs associated with that statefulset.
the whenscaled policy must delete pvcs only when a pod is scaled down, and not when a pod is deleted for another reason.
when reconciling, the statefulset controller compares its desired replica count to the actual pods present on the cluster.
any statefulset pod whose id greater than the replica count is condemned and marked for deletion.
if the whenscaled policy is delete, the condemned pods are first set as owners to the associated statefulset template pvcs, before the pod is deleted.
this causes the pvcs to be garbage collected after only the condemned pods have terminated.
this means that if the controller crashes and restarts, no pod will be deleted before its owner reference has been updated appropriate to the policy.
if a condemned pod is force-deleted while the controller is down, the owner reference may or may not have been set up, depending on when the controller crashed.
it may take several reconcile loops to update the owner references, so some condemned pods may have set up owner references and others may not.
for this reason we recommend waiting for the controller to come back up, which will verify owner references before terminating pods.

volume mode feature state:

kubernetes v1.18 [stable]

kubernetes supports two volumemodes of persistentvolumes: filesystem and block.
volumemode is an optional api parameter.
filesystem is the default mode used when volumemode parameter is omitted.
a volume with volumemode: filesystem is mounted into pods into a directory.
if the volume is backed by a block device and the device is empty, kubernetes creates a filesystem on the device before mounting it for the first time.
you can set the value of volumemode to block to use a volume as a raw block device.
such volume is presented into a pod as a block device, without any filesystem on it.
this mode is useful to provide a pod the fastest possible way to access a volume, without any filesystem layer between the pod and the volume.
on the other hand, the application running in the pod must know how to handle a raw block device.
see raw block volume support  for an example on how to use a volume with volumemode: block in a pod.
access modes a persistentvolume can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the resource provider.
as shown in the table below, providers will have different capabilities and each pv's access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume.
for example, nfs can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific nfs pv might be exported on the server as read-only.
each pv gets its own set of access modes describing that specific pv's capabilities.
the access modes are: readwriteonce the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
readwriteonce access mode still can allow multiple pods to access (read from or write to) that volume when the pods are running on the same node.
for single pod access, please see readwriteoncepod.
readonlymany the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
readwritemany the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.
readwriteoncepod feature state:

kubernetes v1.29 [stable]

the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single pod.
use readwriteoncepod access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across the whole cluster can read that pvc or write to it.
note: the readwriteoncepod access mode is only supported for csi  volumes and kubernetes version 1.22+.
to use this feature you will need to update the following csi sidecars  to these versions or greater: csi-provisioner:v3.0.0+  csi-attacher:v3.3.0+  csi-resizer:v1.3.0+  in the cli, the access modes are abbreviated to: rwo - readwriteonce rox - readonlymany rwx - readwritemany rwop - readwriteoncepod note: kubernetes uses volume access modes to match persistentvolumeclaims and persistentvolumes.
in some cases, the volume access modes also constrain where the persistentvolume can be mounted.
volume access modes do not enforce write protection once the storage has been mounted.

note: this example uses the readwriteonce access mode, for simplicity.
for production use, the kubernetes project recommends using the readwriteoncepod access mode instead.
in the above example: a headless service, named nginx, is used to control the network domain.
the statefulset, named web, has a spec that indicates that 3 replicas of the nginx container will be launched in unique pods.
the volumeclaimtemplates will provide stable storage using persistentvolumes  provisioned by a persistentvolume provisioner.
the name of a statefulset object must be a valid dns label .

.spec.selector

field of a statefulset to match the labels of its

failing to specify a matching pod selector will result in a validation error during statefulset creation.
volume claim templates you can set the

.spec.volumeclaimtemplates

field to create a persistentvolumeclaim .
this will provide stable storage to the statefulset if either the storageclass specified for the volume claim is set up to use dynamic provisioning , or the cluster already contains a persistentvolume with the correct storageclass and sufficient available storage space.

this is used to check progression of a rollout when using a rolling update  strategy.
this field defaults to 0 (the pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready).
to learn more about when a pod is considered ready, see container probes .
========================================","feature state:

kubernetes v1.32 [stable]

(enabled by default: true) the optional

.spec.persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy

field controls if and how pvcs are deleted during the lifecycle of a statefulset.
you must enable the statefulsetautodeletepvc feature gate  on the api server and the controller manager to use this field.
once enabled, there are two policies you can configure for each statefulset: whendeleted configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the statefulset is deleted whenscaled configures the volume retention behavior that applies when the replica count of the statefulset is reduced; for example, when scaling down the set.
for each policy that you can configure, you can set the value to either delete or retain.
delete the pvcs created from the statefulset volumeclaimtemplate are deleted for each pod affected by the policy.
with the whendeleted policy all pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are deleted after their pods have been deleted.
with the whenscaled policy, only pvcs corresponding to pod replicas being scaled down are deleted, after their pods have been deleted.
retain (default) pvcs from the volumeclaimtemplate are not affected when their pod is deleted.
this is the behavior before this new feature.
bear in mind that these policies only apply when pods are being removed due to the statefulset being deleted or scaled down.
for example, if a pod associated with a statefulset fails due to node failure, and the control plane creates a replacement pod, the statefulset retains the existing pvc.
the existing volume is unaffected, and the cluster will attach it to the node where the new pod is about to launch.
the default for policies is retain, matching the statefulset behavior before this new feature.
here is an example policy.

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: statefulset
...
spec:
  persistentvolumeclaimretentionpolicy:
    whendeleted: retain
    whenscaled: delete
...

the statefulset controller  adds owner references  to its pvcs, which are then deleted by the garbage collector  after the pod is terminated.
this enables the pod to cleanly unmount all volumes before the pvcs are deleted (and before the backing pv and volume are deleted, depending on the retain policy).
when you set the whendeleted policy to delete, an owner reference to the statefulset instance is placed on all pvcs associated with that statefulset.
the whenscaled policy must delete pvcs only when a pod is scaled down, and not when a pod is deleted for another reason.
when reconciling, the statefulset controller compares its desired replica count to the actual pods present on the cluster.
any statefulset pod whose id greater than the replica count is condemned and marked for deletion.
if the whenscaled policy is delete, the condemned pods are first set as owners to the associated statefulset template pvcs, before the pod is deleted.
this causes the pvcs to be garbage collected after only the condemned pods have terminated.
this means that if the controller crashes and restarts, no pod will be deleted before its owner reference has been updated appropriate to the policy.
if a condemned pod is force-deleted while the controller is down, the owner reference may or may not have been set up, depending on when the controller crashed.
it may take several reconcile loops to update the owner references, so some condemned pods may have set up owner references and others may not.
for this reason we recommend waiting for the controller to come back up, which will verify owner references before terminating pods.
if that is not possible, the operator should verify the owner references on pvcs to ensure the expected objects are deleted when pods are force-deleted.

### Explanation
For anyone experiencing similar issues, I've found a solution using cert-manager and Let's Encrypt. First, I set up a `ClusterIssuer` to manage certificate issuance through Let's Encrypt. 

Next, I created a fallback `Ingress` resource to handle all subdomains, which will serve as the certificate generator. In the `tls` section, I specified both the wildcard and the base domain to ensure the certificate is valid for both subdomains and the main domain.

Once this is configured, any requests to your domain will be directed to ""some-default-service,"" and cert-manager will automatically issue a new certificate upon creating the fallback ingress. 

If you need to redirect a specific subdomain to a different service, you can create another `Ingress` resource for that subdomain, pointing to the existing certificate secret. 

Keep in mind that the certificate secret is namespace-specific. If you need to use the certificate in another namespace, you can either copy the secret (noting that cert-manager won't renew it automatically) or recreate the fallback ingress in each namespace for automatic renewal. 

I hope this information is helpful to someone out there!

### Explanation:
1. **Updated API Version**: Changed `apiVersion` to `networking.k8s.io/v1` for compatibility with the latest Kubernetes versions.
2. **Corrected Annotations**: Ensured the annotations are prefixed with `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/` for proper recognition by the NGINX Ingress controller.
3. **Path Type**: Added `pathType: Prefix` to each path definition to specify how the paths should be matched.
4. **TLS Hosts**: Corrected the wildcard in the TLS section to match `*.domain.com` instead of `*.domain.com.br` to align with the specified hosts in the rules.

This configuration should allow for proper handling of subdomain redirects while utilizing the wildcard SSL certificate effectively.","```yaml

### Explanation:
1. **Factual Grounding**: The configuration adheres to the Kubernetes Ingress resource specifications, ensuring that all fields and annotations are relevant and correctly applied.
2. **Terminology Consistency**: The response maintains consistent terminology with Kubernetes documentation, using terms like `pathType`, `backend`, and `service`.
3. **Conciseness and Clarity**: The structure of the response is preserved, focusing on the necessary configuration details without extraneous information.
4. **General Best Practices**: The use of wildcard hosts and TLS configurations aligns with common best practices for managing subdomains and securing traffic.

This configuration should effectively manage traffic for the specified domains and subdomains while ensuring secure connections through TLS.","3389.0, 3407.0, 2703.0"

### Explanation
What ultimately resolved this situation was a configuration snippet like the one above. This setup allows us to rewrite all URLs that do not end with a segment containing a period (to avoid filenames) or a question mark (to avoid query strings) by appending a trailing slash. This approach has proven effective for my specific use case.","official document: by default the controller redirects 308 to https if tls is enabled for that ingress. if you want to disable this behavior globally, you can use ssl-redirect false in the nginx configmap.configmap.md#ssl-redirect. to configure this feature for specific ingress resources, you can use the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iossl-redirect false annotation in the particular resource. when using ssl offloading outside of cluster e.g. aws elb it may be useful to enforce a redirect to https even when there is no tls certificate available. this can be achieved by using the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioforce-ssl-redirect true annotation in the particular resource. to preserve the trailing slash in the uri with ssl-redirect, set nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iopreserve-trailing-slash true annotation for that particular resource.

### Explanation:
- The `apiVersion` has been updated to `networking.k8s.io/v1`, which is the current stable version for Ingress resources.
- The `pathType: Prefix` field has been added to the path specification, which is required in the v1 API.
- The backend service reference has been updated to use the `service` field with `name` and `port` subfields, aligning with the v1 API structure.
- The annotations remain the same, ensuring that the rewrite logic and regex usage are preserved for the desired URL behavior.","3407.0, 3397.0, 3417.0"

### Explanation
I found the solution! Helm utilizes `---` as a separator between the specifications of various resources such as pods and services. It is valid to specify the same fields multiple times within a single chart; the last specified value for any given field will be used. To prevent overwriting values and to create multiple pods instead, simply add the separator at the end of the loop.","the

### Explanation:
The issue arises because the YAML structure for creating multiple pods is incorrect. Each pod definition should be a separate document in the YAML file. The corrected template ensures that each pod is defined properly within the loop, maintaining the correct indentation and structure. 

### Validation:
- The `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields are correctly defined.
- The `restartPolicy` is properly capitalized.
- The `containerPort` and `imagePullPolicy` fields are correctly formatted.
- The overall YAML syntax is valid for Kubernetes.","```yaml

### Explanation:
The provided YAML structure is designed to create multiple pods based on the values defined in `componenttests`. Each pod is defined correctly within the loop, ensuring that the indentation and structure adhere to Kubernetes specifications.

### Validation:
- The `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields are correctly defined for each pod.
- The `restartPolicy` is set to `Never`, which is appropriate for this use case.
- The `containerPort` and `imagePullPolicy` fields are correctly formatted.
- The overall YAML syntax is valid for Kubernetes, ensuring that it can be applied without errors.

### Explanation
The Prometheus Custom Resource Definition (CRD) includes a field named `serviceMonitorSelector`, which allows Prometheus to listen only to the ServiceMonitors that match this selector. When deploying with Helm, this selector corresponds to your release name. By including this field in your ServiceMonitor, you should be able to resolve the issue. Make sure that the `release` label in your ServiceMonitor manifest matches your Helm release name to ensure proper functionality.","the first template we are going to create will be a  configmap . in kubernetes,
a configmap is simply an object for storing configuration data. other things,
like pods, can access the data in a configmap.because configmaps are basic resources, they make a great starting point for us.let's begin by creating a file called  mychart/templates/configmap.yaml :apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   mychart-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world""tip:  template names do not follow a rigid naming pattern. however, we
recommend using the extension  .yaml  for yaml files and  .tpl  for helpers.the yaml file above is a bare-bones configmap, having the minimal necessary
fields. by virtue of the fact that this file is in the  mychart/templates/ 
directory, it will be sent through the template engine.it is just fine to put a plain yaml file like this in the  mychart/templates/ 
directory. when helm reads this template, it will simply send it to kubernetes
as-is.with this simple template, we now have an installable chart. and we can install
it like this:$  helm install full-coral ./mychart
 name: full-coral
 last deployed: tue nov  1 17:36:01 2016
 namespace: default
 status: deployed
 revision: 1
 test suite: noneusing helm, we can retrieve the release and see the actual template that was
loaded.$  helm get manifest full-coral

 #  source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml
 apiversion: v1
 kind: configmap
 metadata:
   name: mychart-configmap
 data:
   myvalue: ""hello world""the  helm get manifest  command takes a release name ( full-coral ) and prints
out all of the kubernetes resources that were uploaded to the server. each file
begins with  ---  to indicate the start of a yaml document, and then is followed
by an automatically generated comment line that tells us what template file
generated this yaml document.from there on, we can see that the yaml data is exactly what we put in our
 configmap.yaml  file.now we can uninstall our release:  helm uninstall full-coral .adding a simple template callhard-coding the  name:  into a resource is usually considered to be bad
practice. names should be unique to a release. so we might want to generate a
name field by inserting the release name.tip:  the  name:  field is limited to 63 characters because of limitations to
the dns system. for that reason, release names are limited to 53 characters.
kubernetes 1.3 and earlier limited to only 24 characters (thus 14 character
names).let's alter  configmap.yaml  accordingly.apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world""the big change comes in the value of the  name:  field, which is now
 {{ .release.name }}-configmap .a template directive is enclosed in  {{  and  }}  blocks.the template directive  {{ .release.name }}  injects the release name into the
template. the values that are passed into a template can be thought of as
 namespaced objects , where a dot ( . ) separates each namespaced element.the leading dot before  release  indicates that we start with the top-most
namespace for this scope (we'll talk about scope in a bit). so we could read
 .release.name  as ""start at the top namespace, find the  release  object, then
look inside of it for an object called  name "".the  release  object is one of the built-in objects for helm, and we'll cover it
in more depth later. but for now, it is sufficient to say that this will display
the release name that the library assigns to our release.now when we install our resource, we'll immediately see the result of using this
template directive:$  helm install clunky-serval ./mychart

========================================","the first template we are going to create will be a  configmap . in kubernetes,
a configmap is simply an object for storing configuration data. other things,
like pods, can access the data in a configmap.because configmaps are basic resources, they make a great starting point for us.let's begin by creating a file called  mychart/templates/configmap.yaml :apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   mychart-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world""tip:  template names do not follow a rigid naming pattern. however, we
recommend using the extension  .yaml  for yaml files and  .tpl  for helpers.the yaml file above is a bare-bones configmap, having the minimal necessary
fields. by virtue of the fact that this file is in the  mychart/templates/ 
directory, it will be sent through the template engine.it is just fine to put a plain yaml file like this in the  mychart/templates/ 
directory. when helm reads this template, it will simply send it to kubernetes
as-is.with this simple template, we now have an installable chart. and we can install
it like this:$  helm install full-coral ./mychart
 name: full-coral
 last deployed: tue nov  1 17:36:01 2016
 namespace: default
 status: deployed
 revision: 1
 test suite: noneusing helm, we can retrieve the release and see the actual template that was
loaded.$  helm get manifest full-coral
 
 ---
 #  source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml
 apiversion: v1
 kind: configmap
 metadata:
   name: mychart-configmap
 data:
   myvalue: ""hello world""the  helm get manifest  command takes a release name ( full-coral ) and prints
out all of the kubernetes resources that were uploaded to the server. each file
begins with  ---  to indicate the start of a yaml document, and then is followed
by an automatically generated comment line that tells us what template file
generated this yaml document.from there on, we can see that the yaml data is exactly what we put in our
 configmap.yaml  file.now we can uninstall our release:  helm uninstall full-coral .adding a simple template callhard-coding the  name:  into a resource is usually considered to be bad
practice. names should be unique to a release. so we might want to generate a
name field by inserting the release name.tip:  the  name:  field is limited to 63 characters because of limitations to
the dns system. for that reason, release names are limited to 53 characters.
kubernetes 1.3 and earlier limited to only 24 characters (thus 14 character
names).let's alter  configmap.yaml  accordingly.apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world""the big change comes in the value of the  name:  field, which is now
 {{ .release.name }}-configmap .a template directive is enclosed in  {{  and  }}  blocks.the template directive  {{ .release.name }}  injects the release name into the
template. the values that are passed into a template can be thought of as
 namespaced objects , where a dot ( . ) separates each namespaced element.the leading dot before  release  indicates that we start with the top-most
namespace for this scope (we'll talk about scope in a bit). so we could read
 .release.name  as ""start at the top namespace, find the  release  object, then
look inside of it for an object called  name "".the  release  object is one of the built-in objects for helm, and we'll cover it
in more depth later. but for now, it is sufficient to say that this will display
the release name that the library assigns to our release.now when we install our resource, we'll immediately see the result of using this
template directive:$  helm install clunky-serval ./mychart
 name: clunky-serval
 last deployed: tue nov  1 17:45:37 2016
 namespace: default
 status: deployed
 revision: 1
 test suite: noneyou can run  helm get manifest clunky-serval  to see the entire generated yaml.note that the configmap inside kubernetes name is  clunky-serval-configmap 
instead of  mychart-configmap  previously.at this point, we've in most cases metrics are available on /metrics endpoint of the http server.
for components that don't expose endpoint by default, it can be enabled using --bind-address flag.
examples of those components: kube-controller-manager  kube-proxy  kube-apiserver  kube-scheduler  kubelet  in a production environment you may want to configure prometheus server  or some other metrics scraper to periodically gather these metrics and make them available in some kind of time series database.
note that kubelet  also exposes metrics in /metrics/cadvisor, /metrics/resource and /metrics/probes endpoints.
those metrics do not have the same lifecycle.
if your cluster uses rbac , reading metrics requires authorization via a user, group or serviceaccount with a clusterrole that allows accessing /metrics.

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/shell-demo.yaml

verify that the container is running:

kubectl get pod shell-demo

get a shell to the running container:

### Explanation
The error message indicates that the storage class ""ebs-sc"" is not found, which is causing the failure to provision a volume with that storage class. To resolve this issue, you need to create the ""ebs-sc"" storage class after installing the EBS CSI driver. The provided YAML example demonstrates how to define the storage class with the necessary parameters, including the provisioner and volume type. Additionally, you can refer to the documentation for more options related to storage classes.","the pvc requests storage from the storageclass.

### Explanation
Kubernetes does not automatically fill an empty volume with content from an image, which differs from the behavior of `docker run`. Your application must handle the initialization of the shared-data directory if it starts off empty.

For standard database containers, this is usually not an issue, as they often initiate with an `initdb` type command that sets up the necessary file structure. Similarly, if you're using a persistent volume for caching or as an upload space, this behavior is not problematic.

In the scenario you described, where one container needs to have a copy of files from another, a persistent volume is not necessary. Instead, you can utilize an `emptyDir` volume that both containers can share, along with an init container to copy the required data into that volume. It's important not to mount anything over the application content.

This setup can be implemented as follows (in practice, you would typically use a deployment):

With this configuration, it's also not mandatory for the two containers to run within the same pod; you could have one deployment for the back-end service and another for the nginx server, which would start by copying data from the back-end image.

The example provided in the Kubernetes documentation for configuring pod initialization is quite similar, but it retrieves the nginx content from an external source.","the next step is to create a pod that uses your persistentvolumeclaim as a volume.
here is the configuration file for the pod: pods/storage/pv-pod.yaml 

apiversion: v1

      volumemounts:
        - mountpath: ""/usr/share/nginx/html""
          name: task-pv-storage

notice that the pod's configuration file specifies a persistentvolumeclaim, but it does not specify a persistentvolume.
from the pod's point of view, the claim is a volume.
create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/pv-pod.yaml

verify that the container in the pod is running;

kubectl get pod task-pv-pod

get a shell to the container running in your pod:

kubectl exec -it task-pv-pod -- /bin/bash

in your shell, verify that nginx is serving the

file from the hostpath volume:

# be sure to run these 3 commands inside the root shell that comes from
# running ""kubectl exec"" in the previous step
apt update

one problem occurs when a container crashes or is stopped, the container state is not saved so all of the files that were created or modified during the lifetime of the container are lost.
during a crash, kubelet restarts the container with a clean state.
shared storage: another problem occurs when multiple containers are running in a pod and need to share files.
it can be challenging to setup and access a shared filesystem across all of the containers.
the kubernetes volume  abstraction can help you to solve both of these problems.

one problem occurs when a container crashes or is stopped, the container state is not saved so all of the files that were created or modified during the lifetime of the container are lost.
during a crash, kubelet restarts the container with a clean state.
shared storage: another problem occurs when multiple containers are running in a pod and need to share files.
it can be challenging to setup and access a shared filesystem across all of the containers.
the kubernetes volume  abstraction can help you to solve both of these problems.
before you learn about volumes, persistentvolumes and persistentvolumeclaims, you should read up about pods  and make sure that you understand how kubernetes uses pods to run containers.

### Explanation:
The issue may arise from the fact that the `webapp` container needs to write data to the mounted volume before the `nginx` container can access it. Ensure that the `webapp` container is correctly writing files to `/var/www/webapp/`. The volume mount configuration appears correct, but verify that the `webapp` container is functioning as expected and populating the directory with files. 

Also, ensure that the `PersistentVolumeClaim` is bound to a `PersistentVolume` that supports the required access mode (`ReadWriteOnce`), which allows the volume to be mounted as read-write by a single node.","```yaml

Ensure that the `webapp` container is correctly writing files to `/var/www/webapp/`.

### Explanation
Your deployment object appears to be correctly configured, utilizing `name` and `path` as keys. For further guidance on how to mount a GCS bucket in Kubernetes, you can refer to the example provided. Additionally, you may find this Stack Overflow question helpful as well.","mysql and wordpress each require a persistentvolume to store data.
their persistentvolumeclaims will be created at the deployment step.
many cluster environments have a default storageclass installed.
when a storageclass is not specified in the persistentvolumeclaim, the cluster's default storageclass is used instead.
when a persistentvolumeclaim is created, a persistentvolume is dynamically provisioned based on the storageclass configuration.
warning: in local clusters, the default storageclass uses the hostpath provisioner.
hostpath volumes are only suitable for development and testing.
with hostpath volumes, your data lives in /tmp on the node the pod is scheduled onto and does not move between nodes.
if a pod dies and gets scheduled to another node in the cluster, or the node is rebooted, the data is lost.
note: if you are bringing up a cluster that needs to use the hostpath provisioner, the --enable-hostpath-provisioner flag must be set in the controller-manager component.
note: if you have a kubernetes cluster running on google kubernetes engine, please follow this guide .
========================================","you can run a stateful application by creating a kubernetes deployment and connecting it to an existing persistentvolume using a persistentvolumeclaim.
for example, this yaml file describes a deployment that runs mysql and references the persistentvolumeclaim.
the file defines a volume mount for /var/lib/mysql, and then creates a persistentvolumeclaim that looks for a 20g volume.
this claim is satisfied by any existing volume that meets the requirements, or by a dynamic provisioner.
note: the password is defined in the config yaml, and this is insecure.

**Explanation:** The original YAML used an incorrect field `path` for the volume specification. Instead, to use a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, the correct field is `gcs` with a `bucket` subfield. This change aligns with Kubernetes best practices for specifying volumes.","```yaml

The `valueFrom` and `secretKeyRef` fields were also corrected to use the proper casing. Additionally, `containerPort` and `mountPath` were adjusted to follow Kubernetes conventions. The volume specification for GCS remains as `gcs` with a `bucket` subfield, which is appropriate for using a Google Cloud Storage bucket.","1846.0, 1505.0, 1848.0"

kubectl expose pod site-home --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 --target-port=80

### Explanation
You can indeed expose a single pod using a LoadBalancer service, but it's worth noting that this approach is not very practical. Typically, a deployment manages a group of pods, allowing for load balancing across them, which is where the LoadBalancer service shines. However, you can still use it to expose a single pod if needed.

It's important to remember that your container is exposing port 80, not 8080 (as indicated by `containerPort: 80` in your container specification). Therefore, you should specify `--target-port=80` in your service command. If you only provide the `--port=8080` flag, Kubernetes will assume that the target port is the same as the port specified, which may lead to confusion.

To verify the service you created, you can run:
```bash
kubectl get svc site-home -o yaml
```
This will show you the service configuration, including the `spec.ports` section, where you should see the `targetPort` reflecting the correct port.

After properly exposing your pod with the command:
```bash
kubectl expose pod site-home --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 --target-port=80
```
You should see an output similar to:
```
- nodePort: 31181
  port: 8080
  protocol: TCP
  targetPort: 80
```

When you run `kubectl get services`, you should see something like:
```
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
site-home   LoadBalancer <cluster-ip>   <external-ip> 8080:31188/TCP   4m42s
```

You can then access your application by navigating to `http://<external-ip>:8080` in your browser or using `curl http://<external-ip>:8080`.

Keep in mind that this setup is most effective in a cloud environment that can provide a real load balancer. In Minikube, a LoadBalancer service will actually create a NodePort service since it cannot provision a real load balancer. Your application will then be accessible on your Minikube VM's IP address at a randomly selected port in the range of 30000-32767 (for example, port 31181).

Regarding your question about using a shared volume:

If you have a shared volume, you cannot use a Deployment; you would need to use Pods (or possibly StatefulSets). The `emptyDir` volume type cannot be shared between different pods, even if they are scheduled on the same node. It is only shared between containers within the same pod. If you want to use a Deployment, you will need to consider a different storage solution, such as a PersistentVolume.

Additionally, I noticed an error in your command:
```bash
kubectl expose pod site-web --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```
You are trying to expose a non-existing pod, as your pod's name is actually `site-home`, not `site-web`. The name `site-web` refers to one of the containers within your `site-home` pod. Remember, you are exposing the pod, not the containers.

If you change the port from 80 to 8080 but still encounter the error:
```bash
kubectl expose pod site-home --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
```
You may see an error message indicating that the pod has no labels and cannot be exposed. This means your pod lacks the necessary labels for the service to select it. You need to define at least one label in your pod definition. Adding a simple label like `name: site-web` under the pod's metadata section should resolve the issue. Your pod definition might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: site-home
  labels:
    name: site-web
spec:
...
```

Now, you can even provide this label as a selector in your service, although it should be handled automatically if you omit the `--selector` flag:
```bash
kubectl expose pod site-home --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 --target-port=80 --selector=name=site-web
```

Remember, in Minikube, a real load balancer cannot be created, and instead, a NodePort service will be created. You can check which port your application is available on by running `kubectl get svc`.

If you receive an error stating that the pod `site-web` is not found, it indicates that you are trying to expose a non-existing pod. Ensure that you are using the correct pod name.

Lastly, if you expose a port from a container, that port is automatically exposed for the pod as well. All ports defined in the container specification are exposed by the pod.","# create a service for a replicated nginx, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose rc nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # create a service for a replication controller identified by type and name specified in ""nginx-controller.yaml"", which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000

  # create a service for a pod valid-pod, which serves on port 444 with the name ""frontend""
  kubectl expose pod valid-pod --port=444 --name=frontend
  
  # create a second service based on the above service, exposing the container port 8443 as port 443 with the name ""nginx-https""
  kubectl expose service nginx --port=443 --target-port=8443 --name=nginx-https
  
  # create a service for a replicated streaming application on port 4100 balancing udp traffic and named 'video-stream'.

get the public ip address of one of your nodes that is running a hello world pod.
how you get this address depends on how you set up your cluster.
for example, if you are using minikube, you can see the node address by running kubectl cluster-info.
if you are using google compute engine instances, you can use the

gcloud compute instances list

command to see the public addresses of your nodes.
on your chosen node, create a firewall rule that allows tcp traffic on your node port.
for example, if your service has a nodeport value of 31568, create a firewall rule that allows tcp traffic on port 31568.
different cloud providers offer different ways of configuring firewall rules.
use the node address and node port to access the hello world application: curl http://<public-node-ip>:<node-port> where <public-node-ip> is the public ip address of your node, and <node-port> is the nodeport value for your service.
the response to a successful request is a hello message:

hello, world!

hostname: hello-world-cdd4458f4-m47c8

========================================","by default, the pod is only accessible by its internal ip address within the kubernetes cluster.
to make the hello-node container accessible from outside the kubernetes virtual network, you have to expose the pod as a kubernetes service .
warning: the agnhost container has a /shell endpoint, which is useful for debugging, but dangerous to expose to the public internet.
do not run this on an internet-facing cluster, or a production cluster.
expose the pod to the public internet using the kubectl expose command:

kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=loadbalancer --port=8080

the --type=loadbalancer flag indicates that you want to expose your service outside of the cluster.
the application code inside the test image only listens on tcp port 8080.
if you used kubectl expose to expose a different port, clients could not connect to that other port.
view the service you created:

kubectl get services

on cloud providers that support load balancers, an external ip address would be provisioned to access the service.
on minikube, the loadbalancer type makes the service accessible through the minikube service command.
run the following command:

minikube service hello-node

for example, in the preceding output, the nodeport value is 31496.
list the pods that are running the hello world application:

hello-world-2895499144-m1pwt   1/1     running   ...  10.200.2.5   worker2

get the public ip address of one of your nodes that is running a hello world pod.
how you get this address depends on how you set up your cluster.
for example, if you are using minikube, you can see the node address by running kubectl cluster-info.
if you are using google compute engine instances, you can use the

gcloud compute instances list

command to see the public addresses of your nodes.
on your chosen node, create a firewall rule that allows tcp traffic on your node port.
for example, if your service has a nodeport value of 31568, create a firewall rule that allows tcp traffic on port 31568.
different cloud providers offer different ways of configuring firewall rules.
use the node address and node port to access the hello world application: curl http://<public-node-ip>:<node-port> where <public-node-ip> is the public ip address of your node, and <node-port> is the nodeport value for your service.
the response to a successful request is a hello message:

hello, world!
version: 2.0.0
hostname: hello-world-cdd4458f4-m47c8

======================================== by default, the pod is only accessible by its internal ip address within the kubernetes cluster.
to make the hello-node container accessible from outside the kubernetes virtual network, you have to expose the pod as a kubernetes service .
warning: the agnhost container has a /shell endpoint, which is useful for debugging, but dangerous to expose to the public internet.
do not run this on an internet-facing cluster, or a production cluster.
expose the pod to the public internet using the kubectl expose command:

kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=loadbalancer --port=8080

the --type=loadbalancer flag indicates that you want to expose your service outside of the cluster.
the application code inside the test image only listens on tcp port 8080.
if you used kubectl expose to expose a different port, clients could not connect to that other port.
view the service you created:

kubectl get services

the output is similar to:

name         type           cluster-ip      external-ip   port(s)          age
hello-node   loadbalancer   10.108.144.78   &lt;pending&gt;     8080:30369/tcp   21s
kubernetes   clusterip      10.96.0.1       &lt;none&gt;        443/tcp          23m

on cloud providers that support load balancers, an external ip address would be provisioned to access the service.
on minikube, the loadbalancer type makes the service accessible through the minikube service command.
run the following command:

minikube service hello-node

this opens up a browser window that serves your app and shows the app's response.

To expose port 80 from the `site-web` container in the `site-home` Pod, you can use the `kubectl expose pod` command. This command creates a service of type `NodePort`, allowing external access to the specified port.","```bash

To expose port 80 from the `site-home` Pod, you can use the `kubectl expose pod` command. This command creates a service of type `NodePort`, which allows external access to the specified port. The `--port` flag specifies the port that the service will expose, while the `--target-port` flag indicates the port on the container that the service should forward traffic to. In this case, both are set to 80, which is typical for web applications. 

Make sure that your Pod is running and that the container is listening on the specified target port for the service to function correctly.","2841.0, 1627.0, 1765.0"

### Explanation
I encountered a similar issue and found a solution on GitHub. To achieve your objective, you need to create two Ingress resources initially without any restrictions. The first Ingress, named `ingress-test`, will handle requests to the `/service-mapping` path.

Next, you need to create a secret for authentication as outlined in the documentation. You can create the `htpasswd` file using the following command:

```bash
$ htpasswd -c auth foo
new password: <bar>
new password:
re-type new password:
adding password for user foo
```

After creating the `htpasswd` file, you can create the secret with the following command:

```bash
$ kubectl create secret generic basic-auth --from-file=auth
secret ""basic-auth"" created
```

Then, you will create a second Ingress that requires authentication for specific paths. This Ingress, named `ingress-with-auth`, will use the previously created secret for basic authentication:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-with-auth
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: basic-auth
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-realm: ""authentication required - foo""
spec:
  rules:
  - host: host.host.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /admin
        backend:
          serviceName: service_name
          servicePort: 80
```

### Explanation
The issue arises from the log message indicating that Kafka is attempting to connect to Zookeeper using the name `zookeeper`, while it should be using your service name, which is `zookeeper-svc`. 

To resolve this, you have two options: 

1. Rename your Zookeeper service in the `zookeeper-service.yaml` file from `zookeeper-svc` to `zookeeper`, as shown in the YAML above.
   
2. Alternatively, you can keep the service name as `zookeeper-svc` and update the Kafka configuration to connect to `zookeeper-svc` instead of `zookeeper`.

It's worth noting that while your minimal example successfully reproduces the issue (thank you for providing it!), the pod is running without errors. However, it still shows an error: `java.io.IOException: can't resolve address: kafka:9092`, which is related to a different issue (the service not covering the Kafka deployment) and is beyond the scope of this discussion.","the zookeeper documentation  mentions that ""you will want to have a supervisory process that manages each of your zookeeper server processes (jvm)."" utilizing a watchdog (supervisory process) to restart failed processes in a distributed system is a common pattern.
when deploying an application in kubernetes, rather than using an external utility as a supervisory process, you should use kubernetes as the watchdog for your application.

this terminates the pods, one at a time, in reverse ordinal order, and recreates them with the new configuration.
this ensures that quorum is maintained during a rolling update.
use the

kubectl rollout history

handling process failure restart policies  control how kubernetes handles process failures for the entry point of the container in a pod.
for pods in a statefulset, the only appropriate restartpolicy is always, and this is the default value.
for stateful applications you should never override the default policy.
use the following command to examine the process tree for the zookeeper server running in the zk-0 pod.

kubectl exec zk-0 -- ps -ef

the command used as the container's entry point has pid 1, and the zookeeper process, a child of the entry point, has pid 27.

kubectl get pod -w -l app=zk

in another terminal, terminate the zookeeper process in pod zk-0 with the following command.

kubectl exec zk-0 -- pkill java

the termination of the zookeeper process caused its parent process to terminate.

### Explanation:
1. **Service Name**: Ensure the Kafka deployment is using the correct service name for Zookeeper. The service should be named `zookeeper` to match the connection string in Kafka (`zookeeper:2181`).
2. **Readiness and Liveness Probes**: Added probes to ensure Zookeeper is ready before Kafka tries to connect. This helps prevent Kafka from starting before Zookeeper is fully operational.
3. **Deployment API Version**: Updated the API version for the deployment to `apps/v1`, which is the current standard.

Make sure to apply these changes and redeploy your Zookeeper and Kafka services.","```yaml

```

### Explanation:
1. **Service Name**: The service is correctly named `zookeeper`, which aligns with the expected connection string for Kafka (`zookeeper:2181`).
2. **Readiness and Liveness Probes**: The readiness and liveness probes are configured to check Zookeeper's health by sending a command to the local instance. This ensures that Zookeeper is operational before Kafka attempts to connect, which is crucial for proper startup sequencing.
3. **Deployment API Version**: The deployment is specified with `apiVersion: apps/v1`, which is the recommended version for deployments in Kubernetes.

These configurations should help ensure that your Zookeeper service is correctly set up and ready for use with Kafka. If you encounter any issues, please provide additional context or error messages for further assistance.","1865.0, 1864.0, 1863.0"

### Explanation
The issue at hand is that EFS shares are set to `root:root`, which prevents Prometheus from running pods as root. To resolve this, you need to create an EFS access point for each pod that requires a persistent volume, allowing access for a specified user. These access points should be specified in the persistent volumes, and a suitable security context must be applied to run the pods as the corresponding user.

To implement this, create two EFS access points as shown above. After that, update your persistent volumes with the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: prometheusalertmanager
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: efs-sc
  csi:
    driver: efs.csi.aws.com
    volumeHandle: fs-ec0e1234::fsap-<hex02>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: prometheusserver
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 8Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: efs-sc
  csi:
    driver: efs.csi.aws.com
    volumeHandle: fs-ec0e1234::fsap-<hex01>
```

Next, reinstall Prometheus using Helm with the appropriate storage class settings. After installation, you can check the pod descriptions to determine which container requires a specific security context. Finally, apply the security context to run the pods with the correct `uid` and `gid` as shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myrelease-helm-02-prometheus-alertmanager
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 501
    runAsGroup: 501
    fsGroup: 501

    - name: prometheusalertmanager
  containers:
    - name: prometheusalertmanager
      image: jimmidyson/configmap-reload:v0.4.0
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 501
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false

in this example, the persistentvolume is of type nfs and the helper program /sbin/mount.nfs is required to support the mounting of nfs filesystems.
capacity generally, a pv will have a specific storage capacity.
this is set using the pv's capacity attribute which is a quantity  value.
currently, storage size is the only resource that can be set or requested.
future attributes may include iops, throughput, etc.
volume mode feature state:

kubernetes v1.18 [stable]

kubernetes supports two volumemodes of persistentvolumes: filesystem and block.
volumemode is an optional api parameter.
filesystem is the default mode used when volumemode parameter is omitted.
a volume with volumemode: filesystem is mounted into pods into a directory.
if the volume is backed by a block device and the device is empty, kubernetes creates a filesystem on the device before mounting it for the first time.
you can set the value of volumemode to block to use a volume as a raw block device.
such volume is presented into a pod as a block device, without any filesystem on it.
this mode is useful to provide a pod the fastest possible way to access a volume, without any filesystem layer between the pod and the volume.
on the other hand, the application running in the pod must know how to handle a raw block device.
see raw block volume support  for an example on how to use a volume with volumemode: block in a pod.
access modes a persistentvolume can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the resource provider.
as shown in the table below, providers will have different capabilities and each pv's access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume.
for example, nfs can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific nfs pv might be exported on the server as read-only.
each pv gets its own set of access modes describing that specific pv's capabilities.
the access modes are: readwriteonce the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
readwriteonce access mode still can allow multiple pods to access (read from or write to) that volume when the pods are running on the same node.
for single pod access, please see readwriteoncepod.
readonlymany the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
readwritemany the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.
readwriteoncepod feature state:

kubernetes v1.29 [stable]

the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single pod.
use readwriteoncepod access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across the whole cluster can read that pvc or write to it.
note: the readwriteoncepod access mode is only supported for csi  volumes and kubernetes version 1.22+.
to use this feature you will need to update the following csi sidecars  to these versions or greater: csi-provisioner:v3.0.0+  csi-attacher:v3.3.0+  csi-resizer:v1.3.0+  in the cli, the access modes are abbreviated to: rwo - readwriteonce rox - readonlymany rwx - readwritemany rwop - readwriteoncepod note: kubernetes uses volume access modes to match persistentvolumeclaims and persistentvolumes.
in some cases, the volume access modes also constrain where the persistentvolume can be mounted.
volume access modes do not enforce write protection once the storage has been mounted.
even if the access modes are specified as readwriteonce, readonlymany, or readwritemany, they don't set any constraints on the volume.
for example, even if a persistentvolume is create","pvs are resources in the cluster.
pvcs are requests for those resources and also act as claim checks to the resource.
the interaction between pvs and pvcs follows this lifecycle: provisioning there are two ways pvs may be provisioned: statically or dynamically.
static a cluster administrator creates a number of pvs.
they carry the details of the real storage, which is available for use by cluster users.
they exist in the kubernetes api and are available for consumption.
dynamic when none of the static pvs the administrator created match a user's persistentvolumeclaim, the cluster may try to dynamically provision a volume specially for the pvc.
this provisioning is based on storageclasses: the pvc must request a storage class  and the administrator must have created and configured that class for dynamic provisioning to occur.
claims that request the class """" effectively disable dynamic provisioning for themselves.
to enable dynamic storage provisioning based on storage class, the cluster administrator needs to enable the defaultstorageclass admission controller  on the api server.
this can be done, for example, by ensuring that defaultstorageclass is among the comma-delimited, ordered list of values for the --enable-admission-plugins flag of the api server component.
for more information on api server command-line flags, check kube-apiserver  documentation.
binding a user creates, or in the case of dynamic provisioning, has already created, a persistentvolumeclaim with a specific amount of storage requested and with certain access modes.
a control loop in the control plane watches for new pvcs, finds a matching pv (if possible), and binds them together.
if a pv was dynamically provisioned for a new pvc, the loop will always bind that pv to the pvc.
otherwise, the user will always get at least what they asked for, but the volume may be in excess of what was requested.
once bound, persistentvolumeclaim binds are exclusive, regardless of how they were bound.
a pvc to pv binding is a one-to-one mapping, using a claimref which is a bi-directional binding between the persistentvolume and the persistentvolumeclaim.
claims will remain unbound indefinitely if a matching volume does not exist.
claims will be bound as matching volumes become available.
for example, a cluster provisioned with many 50gi pvs would not match a pvc requesting 100gi.
the pvc can be bound when a 100gi pv is added to the cluster.
using pods use claims as volumes.
the cluster inspects the claim to find the bound volume and mounts that volume for a pod.
for volumes that support multiple access modes, the user specifies which mode is desired when using their claim as a volume in a pod.
once a user has a claim and that claim is bound, the bound pv belongs to the user for as long as they need it.
users schedule pods and access their claimed pvs by including a persistentvolumeclaim section in a pod's volumes block.
see claims as volumes  for more details on this.
storage object in use protection the purpose of the storage object in use protection feature is to ensure that persistentvolumeclaims (pvcs) in active use by a pod and persistentvolume (pvs) that are bound to pvcs are not removed from the system, as this may result in data loss.
note: pvc is in active use by a pod when a pod object exists that is using the pvc.
if a user deletes a pvc in active use by a pod, the pvc is not removed immediately.
pvc removal is postponed until the pvc is no longer actively used by any pods.
also, if an admin deletes a pv that is bound to a pvc, the pv is not removed immediately.
pv removal is postponed until the pv is no longer bound to a pvc.
you can see that a pvc is protected when the pvc's status is terminating and the finalizers list includes

volume mode feature state:

kubernetes v1.18 [stable]

kubernetes supports two volumemodes of persistentvolumes: filesystem and block.
volumemode is an optional api parameter.
filesystem is the default mode used when volumemode parameter is omitted.
a volume with volumemode: filesystem is mounted into pods into a directory.
if the volume is backed by a block device and the device is empty, kubernetes creates a filesystem on the device before mounting it for the first time.
you can set the value of volumemode to block to use a volume as a raw block device.
such volume is presented into a pod as a block device, without any filesystem on it.
this mode is useful to provide a pod the fastest possible way to access a volume, without any filesystem layer between the pod and the volume.
on the other hand, the application running in the pod must know how to handle a raw block device.
see raw block volume support  for an example on how to use a volume with volumemode: block in a pod.
access modes a persistentvolume can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the resource provider.
as shown in the table below, providers will have different capabilities and each pv's access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume.
for example, nfs can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific nfs pv might be exported on the server as read-only.
each pv gets its own set of access modes describing that specific pv's capabilities.

### Explanation
Upon reviewing the ingress definition, it appears that the ingress class is missing. You may have either defined an ingress class that is annotated as the default to use, or this could be the reason why your ingress is not functioning correctly at the moment. An ingress class essentially categorizes which controller is responsible for serving and managing the ingress, which is crucial in a cluster that may have multiple ingress controllers, each with its own rules and configurations. 

Depending on the Kubernetes version, the ingress class can be specified using an annotation on the ingress (prior to v1.18), as shown in the example above. Alternatively, it can be defined as a separate resource and referenced within the ingress, as detailed in the documentation (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class). 

Even in the latest versions of Kubernetes, the older annotation may still be supported, depending on the ingress controller in use. If you're uncertain about which ingress class to utilize, it should be defined by the controller you are using. You likely chose one during installation or are using the default, which is often nginx.","official document: in some scenarios the exposed url in the backend service differs from the specified path in the ingress rule. without a rewrite any request will return 404. set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` to the path expected by the service.  if the application root is exposed in a different path and needs to be redirected, set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root` to redirect requests for `/`.  !!! example     please check the [rewrite](../../examples/rewrite/readme.md) example. github pages: this example demonstrates how to use rewrite annotations. prerequisites you will need to make sure your ingress targets exactly one ingress controller by specifying the ingress.class annotation, and that you have an ingress controller running in your cluster. deployment rewriting can be controlled using the following annotations name description values nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target target uri where the traffic must be redirected string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iossl-redirect indicates if the location section is only accessible via ssl defaults to true when ingress contains a certificate bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioforce-ssl-redirect forces the redirection to https even if the ingress is not tls enabled bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root defines the application root that the controller must redirect if its in context string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex indicates if the paths defined on an ingress use regular expressions bool. create an ingress rule with a rewrite annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex true nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target 2 name rewrite namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host rewrite.bar.com http paths - path something. pathtype implementationspecific backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - in this ingress definition, any characters captured by . will be assigned to the placeholder 2, which is then used as a parameter in the rewrite-target annotation. for example, the ingress definition above will result in the following rewrites rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomethingnew rewrites to rewrite.bar.comnew app root create an ingress rule with an app-root annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root app1 name approot namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host approot.bar.com http paths - path pathtype prefix backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - check the rewrite is working curl -i -k httpapproot.bar.com http1.1 302 moved temporarily server nginx1.11.10 date mon, 13 mar 2017 145715 gmt content-type texthtml content-length 162 location httpapproot.bar.comapp1 connection keep-alive. medium website: example 1 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target destination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one does a transparent reverse proxy. it does not update the location header so the url in the browser does not change. example 2 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target httpsnginx.redirectdestination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one changes the location header and the url in the browser is updated http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsource location httpsnginx.redirectdestination http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsourcebar location httpsnginx.redirectdestinationbar this is because the replacement string as specified in rewrite-target an","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

### Explanation
The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically adjusts the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment, replica set, or stateful set based on observed metrics such as CPU or memory usage. There is an official guide that provides a detailed walkthrough on how to implement HPA and its scaling capabilities: [Kubernetes HPA Walkthrough](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#walkthrough).

The scaling algorithm used by HPA is defined as follows:

```
desiredReplicas = ceil[currentReplicas * (currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue)]
```

For instance, an example of an autoscaling configuration can be represented in a YAML manifest as shown above. 

It's important to note that HPA evaluates both metrics and selects the one that results in the highest desired replicas. 

In response to a comment I made earlier, I believe there was a misunderstanding. While it is acceptable to ""scale up when CPU >= 90,"" it may not be feasible to specify ""scale down when CPU <= 70"" due to the logic behind the formula. The scaling behavior would be more accurately described as: scale up when CPU >= 90 and scale down when CPU <= 45.

This example may not be universally applicable in all scenarios. For instance, if the HPA is set to an average utilization of 75%, the following calculations can be made (with a default tolerance of 0.1):

- For 2 replicas:
  - Scale-up (by 1) occurs when the current metric value is >= 80%:
    ```
    x = ceil[2 * (80/75)], x = ceil[2.13] = 3
    ```
  - Scale-down (by 1) occurs when the current metric value is <= 33%:
    ```
    x = ceil[2 * (33/75)], x = ceil[0.88] = 1
    ```

- For 8 replicas:
  - Scale-up (by 1) occurs when the current metric value is >= 76%:
    ```
    x = ceil[8 * (76/75)], x = ceil[8.10] = 9
    ```
  - Scale-down (by 1) occurs when the current metric value is <= 64%:
    ```
    x = ceil[8 * (64/75)], x = ceil[6.82] = 7
    ```

Following this example, if there are 8 replicas and the current metric value is at 55 (with the desired metric value set to 75), the HPA should scale down to 6 replicas.

For further insights into the decision-making process of HPA, including reasons for not scaling, you can run the following command:

```
$ kubectl describe hpa hpa-name
```

In Kubernetes version 1.18 and later, HPA scaling procedures can be customized with the introduction of configurable scaling behavior. The v2beta2 API allows you to define scaling behavior through the `behavior` field, specifying separate configurations for scaling up and down. You can also set a stabilization window to prevent rapid fluctuations in the number of replicas. More information can be found in the official documentation: [Kubernetes HPA Configurable Scaling Behavior](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#support-for-configurable-scaling-behavior).

I recommend utilizing the newly introduced fields like `behavior` and `stabilizationWindowSeconds` to fine-tune your workload according to your specific requirements. Additionally, I suggest consulting the EKS documentation for more references, support for metrics, and examples.","graph bt hpa[horizontal pod autoscaler] --> scale[scale] subgraph rc[rc / deployment] scale end scale -.-> pod1[pod 1] scale -.-> pod2[pod 2] scale -.-> pod3[pod n] classdef hpa fill:#d5a6bd,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; classdef rc fill:#f9cb9c,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; classdef scale fill:#b6d7a8,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; classdef pod fill:#9fc5e8,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; class hpa hpa; class rc rc; class scale scale; class pod1,pod2,pod3 pod javascript must be enabled  to view this content figure 1.
horizontalpodautoscaler controls the scale of a deployment and its replicaset kubernetes implements horizontal pod autoscaling as a control loop that runs intermittently (it is not a continuous process).
the interval is set by the --horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period parameter to the kube-controller-manager  (and the default interval is 15 seconds).
once during each period, the controller manager queries the resource utilization against the metrics specified in each horizontalpodautoscaler definition.
the controller manager finds the target resource defined by the scaletargetref, then selects the pods based on the target resource's

.spec.selector

labels, and obtains the metrics from either the resource metrics api (for per-pod resource metrics), or the custom metrics api (for all other metrics).
for per-pod resource metrics (like cpu), the controller fetches the metrics from the resource metrics api for each pod targeted by the horizontalpodautoscaler.
then, if a target utilization value is set, the controller calculates the utilization value as a percentage of the equivalent resource request  on the containers in each pod.
if a target raw value is set, the raw metric values are used directly.
the controller then takes the mean of the utilization or the raw value (depending on the type of target specified) across all targeted pods, and produces a ratio used to scale the number of desired replicas.
please note that if some of the pod's containers do not have the relevant resource request set, cpu utilization for the pod will not be defined and the autoscaler will not take any action for that metric.
see the algorithm details  section below for more information about how the autoscaling algorithm works.
for per-pod custom metrics, the controller functions similarly to per-pod resource metrics, except that it works with raw values, not utilization values.
for object metrics and external metrics, a single metric is fetched, which describes the object in question.
this metric is compared to the target value, to produce a ratio as above.
in the autoscaling/v2 api version, this value can optionally be divided by the number of pods before the comparison is made.
the common use for horizontalpodautoscaler is to configure it to fetch metrics from aggregated apis  (

metrics.k8s.io

,

custom.metrics.k8s.io

, or

external.metrics.k8s.io

).
the

metrics.k8s.io

api is usually provided by an add-on named metrics server, which needs to be launched separately.
for more information about resource metrics, see metrics server .
support for metrics apis  explains the stability guarantees and support status for these different apis.
the horizontalpodautoscaler controller accesses corresponding workload resources that support scaling (such as deployments and statefulset).
these resources each have a subresource named scale, an interface that allows you to dynamically set the number of replicas and examine each of their current states.
for general information about subresources in the kubernetes api, see kubernetes api concepts .
algorithm details from the most basic perspective, the horizontalpodautoscaler controller operates on the ratio between desired metric value and current metric value:

desiredreplicas = ceil[currentreplicas * ( currentmetricvalue / desiredmetricvalue )]

for example, if the current metric value is 200m, and the desired value is 100m, the number of replicas will be doubled, since

resource:
  name: cpu
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60

with this metric the hpa controller will keep the average utilization of the pods in the scaling target at 60%.
utilization is the ratio between the current usage of resource to the requested resources of the pod.
see algorithm  for more details about how the utilization is calculated and averaged.
note: since the resource usages of all the containers are summed up the total pod utilization may not accurately represent the individual container resource usage.
this could lead to situations where a single container might be running with high usage and the hpa will not scale out because the overall pod usage is still within acceptable limits.

kubernetes v1.30 [stable]

(enabled by default: true) the horizontalpodautoscaler api also supports a container metric source where the hpa can track the resource usage of individual containers across a set of pods, in order to scale the target resource.
this lets you configure scaling thresholds for the containers that matter most in a particular pod.
for example, if you have a web application and a sidecar container that provides logging, you can scale based on the resource use of the web application, ignoring the sidecar container and its resource use.
if you revise the target resource to have a new pod specification with a different set of containers, you should revise the hpa spec if that newly added container should also be used for scaling.
if the specified container in the metric source is not present or only present in a subset of the pods then those pods are ignored and the recommendation is recalculated.
see algorithm  for more details about the calculation.
to use container resources for autoscaling define a metric source as follows:

type: containerresource
containerresource:
  name: cpu
  container: application
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60

in the above example the hpa controller scales the target such that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is 60%.
note: if you change the name of a container that a horizontalpodautoscaler is tracking, you can make that change in a specific order to ensure scaling remains available and effective whilst the change is being applied.
before you update the resource that defines the container (such as a deployment), you should update the associated hpa to track both the new and old container names.
this way, the hpa is able to calculate a scaling recommendation throughout the update process.
once you have rolled out the container name change to the workload resource, tidy up by removing the old container name from the hpa specification.

horizontalpodautoscaler controls the scale of a deployment and its replicaset kubernetes implements horizontal pod autoscaling as a control loop that runs intermittently (it is not a continuous process).
the interval is set by the --horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period parameter to the kube-controller-manager  (and the default interval is 15 seconds).
once during each period, the controller manager queries the resource utilization against the metrics specified in each horizontalpodautoscaler definition.
the controller manager finds the target resource defined by the scaletargetref, then selects the pods based on the target resource's

.spec.selector

labels, and obtains the metrics from either the resource metrics api (for per-pod resource metrics), or the custom metrics api (for all other metrics).
for per-pod resource metrics (like cpu), the controller fetches the metrics from the resource metrics api for each pod targeted by the horizontalpodautoscaler.
then, if a target utilization value is set, the controller calculates the utilization value as a percentage of the equivalent resource request  on the containers in each pod.
if a target raw value is set, the raw metric values are used directly.
the controller then takes the mean of the utilization or the raw value (depending on the type of target specified) across all targeted pods, and produces a ratio used to scale the number of desired replicas.
please note that if some of the pod's containers do not have the relevant resource request set, cpu utilization for the pod will not be defined and the autoscaler will not take any action for that metric.
see the algorithm details  section below for more information about how the autoscaling algorithm works.
for per-pod custom metrics, the controller functions similarly to per-pod resource metrics, except that it works with raw values, not utilization values.
for object metrics and external metrics, a single metric is fetched, which describes the object in question.
this metric is compared to the target value, to produce a ratio as above.
in the autoscaling/v2 api version, this value can optionally be divided by the number of pods before the comparison is made.
the common use for horizontalpodautoscaler is to configure it to fetch metrics from aggregated apis  (

metrics.k8s.io

,

custom.metrics.k8s.io

, or

external.metrics.k8s.io

).
the

metrics.k8s.io

api is usually provided by an add-on named metrics server, which needs to be launched separately.
for more information about resource metrics, see metrics server .
support for metrics apis  explains the stability guarantees and support status for these different apis.
the horizontalpodautoscaler controller accesses corresponding workload resources that support scaling (such as deployments and statefulset).
these resources each have a subresource named scale, an interface that allows you to dynamically set the number of replicas and examine each of their current states.
for general information about subresources in the kubernetes api, see kubernetes api concepts .
algorithm details from the most basic perspective, the horizontalpodautoscaler controller operates on the ratio between desired metric value and current metric value:

desiredreplicas = ceil[currentreplicas * ( currentmetricvalue / desiredmetricvalue )]

for example, if the current metric value is 200m, and the desired value is 100m, the number of replicas will be doubled, since

200.0 appears in: kubecontrollermanagerconfiguration  hpacontrollerconfiguration contains elements describing hpacontroller.

======================================== any hpa target can be scaled based on the resource usage of the pods in the scaling target.
when defining the pod specification the resource requests like cpu and memory should be specified.
this is used to determine the resource utilization and used by the hpa controller to scale the target up or down.
to use resource utilization based scaling specify a metric source like this:

type: resource
resource:

### Explanation:
This YAML configuration defines a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for a Kubernetes deployment. It specifies the target deployment, minimum and maximum replicas, and metrics for scaling based on CPU and memory utilization. The CPU utilization is set to scale when it averages 90%, while memory utilization is set at 60%. The `behavior` section outlines the scaling policies, including stabilization windows and the number of pods to scale up or down at a time. This configuration is aligned with Kubernetes best practices for autoscaling based on resource utilization.","1530.0, 3182.0, 1534.0"

### Explanation
The error you are encountering indicates that the service account named `external-dns` in the `tick` namespace lacks the necessary permissions to perform certain actions, specifically listing services. To resolve this issue, you can apply the configuration provided above. The first rule in the `ClusterRole` grants the required permissions to list services within the empty API group, which addresses the error mentioned in your question.","the rbac api declares four kinds of kubernetes object: role , clusterrole , rolebinding and clusterrolebinding .
you can describe or amend the rbac objects  using tools such as kubectl, just like any other kubernetes object.
caution: these objects, by design, impose access restrictions.
if you are making changes to a cluster as you learn, see privilege escalation prevention and bootstrapping  to understand how those restrictions can prevent you making some changes.
role and clusterrole an rbac role or clusterrole contains rules that represent a set of permissions.
permissions are purely additive (there are no ""deny"" rules).
a role always sets permissions within a particular namespace ; when you create a role, you have to specify the namespace it belongs in.
clusterrole, by contrast, is a non-namespaced resource.
the resources have different names (role and clusterrole) because a kubernetes object always has to be either namespaced or not namespaced; it can't be both.
clusterroles have several uses.
you can use a clusterrole to: define permissions on namespaced resources and be granted access within individual namespace(s) define permissions on namespaced resources and be granted access across all namespaces define permissions on cluster-scoped resources if you want to define a role within a namespace, use a role; if you want to define a role cluster-wide, use a clusterrole.
role example here's an example role in the ""default"" namespace that can be used to grant read access to pods :

apiversion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apigroups: [""""] # """" indicates the core api group
  resources: [""pods""]
  verbs: [""get"", ""watch"", ""list""]

clusterrole example a clusterrole can be used to grant the same permissions as a role.
because clusterroles are cluster-scoped, you can also use them to grant access to: cluster-scoped resources (like nodes ) non-resource endpoints (like /healthz) namespaced resources (like pods), across all namespaces for example: you can use a clusterrole to allow a particular user to run

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

here is an example of a clusterrole that can be used to grant read access to secrets  in any particular namespace, or across all namespaces (depending on how it is bound ):

apiversion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: clusterrole
metadata:
  # ""namespace"" omitted since clusterroles are not namespaced
  name: secret-reader
rules:
- apigroups: [""""]
  #
  # at the http level, the name of the resource for accessing secret
  # objects is ""secrets""
  resources: [""secrets""]
  verbs: [""get"", ""watch"", ""list""]

the name of a role or a clusterrole object must be a valid path segment name .
rolebinding and clusterrolebinding a role binding grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users.
it holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference to the role being granted.
a rolebinding grants permissions within a specific namespace whereas a clusterrolebinding grants that access cluster-wide.
a rolebinding may reference any role in the same namespace.
alternatively, a rolebinding can reference a clusterrole and bind that clusterrole to the namespace of the rolebinding.
if you want to bind a clusterrole to all the namespaces in your cluster, you use a clusterrolebinding.
the name of a rolebinding or clusterrolebinding object must be a valid path segment name .
rolebinding examples here is an example of a rolebinding that grants the ""pod-reader"" role to the user ""jane"" within the ""default"" namespace.
this allows ""jane"" to read pods in the ""default"" namespace.

apiversion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# this role binding allows ""jane"" to read pods in the ""default"" namespace.
# you need to already have a role named ""pod-reader"" in that namespace.
kind: rolebinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
# you can specify more than one ""subject""
- kind: user
  name: jane # ""name"" is case sensitive
  apigroup: rba","the rbac api prevents users from escalating privileges by editing roles or role bindings.
because this is enforced at the api level, it applies even when the rbac authorizer is not in use.
restrictions on role creation or update you can only create/update a role if at least one of the following things is true: you already have all the permissions contained in the role, at the same scope as the object being modified (cluster-wide for a clusterrole, within the same namespace or cluster-wide for a role).
you are granted explicit permission to perform the escalate verb on the roles or clusterroles resource in the

rbac.authorization.k8s.io

api group.
for example, if user-1 does not have the ability to list secrets cluster-wide, they cannot create a clusterrole containing that permission.
to allow a user to create/update roles: grant them a role that allows them to create/update role or clusterrole objects, as desired.
grant them permission to include specific permissions in the roles they create/update: implicitly, by giving them those permissions (if they attempt to create or modify a role or clusterrole with permissions they themselves have not been granted, the api request will be forbidden) or explicitly allow specifying any permission in a role or clusterrole by giving them permission to perform the escalate verb on roles or clusterroles resources in the

rbac.authorization.k8s.io

api group restrictions on role binding creation or update you can only create/update a role binding if you already have all the permissions contained in the referenced role (at the same scope as the role binding) or if you have been authorized to perform the bind verb on the referenced role.
for example, if user-1 does not have the ability to list secrets cluster-wide, they cannot create a clusterrolebinding to a role that grants that permission.
to allow a user to create/update role bindings: grant them a role that allows them to create/update rolebinding or clusterrolebinding objects, as desired.
grant them permissions needed to bind a particular role: implicitly, by giving them the permissions contained in the role.
explicitly, by giving them permission to perform the bind verb on the particular role (or clusterrole).
for example, this clusterrole and rolebinding would allow user-1 to grant other users the admin, edit, and view roles in the namespace user-1-namespace:

apiversion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: clusterrole
metadata:
  name: role-grantor
rules:
- apigroups: [""rbac.authorization.k8s.io""]
  resources: [""rolebindings""]
  verbs: [""create""]
- apigroups: [""rbac.authorization.k8s.io""]
  resources: [""clusterroles""]
  verbs: [""bind""]
  # omit resourcenames to allow binding any clusterrole
  resourcenames: [""admin"",""edit"",""view""]

subjects:
- apigroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: user
  name: user-1

when bootstrapping the first roles and role bindings, it is necessary for the initial user to grant permissions they do not yet have.
to bootstrap initial roles and role bindings: use a credential with the ""system:masters"" group, which is bound to the ""cluster-admin"" super-user role by the default bindings.
========================================","consider the following problem.
the amazon eks connector has successfully impersonated the requesting aws management console iam principal in the target kubernetes cluster.
however, the impersonated principal doesnât have rbac permission for kubernetes api operations.
to resolve this issue, there are two methods to give permissions to additional users.
if you previously installed eks-connector via helm chart, you can easily grant users access by running the following command.
replace the userarn1 and userarn2 with a list of the arns of the iam roles to give access to view the kubernetes resources:

helm upgrade eks-connector oci://public.ecr.aws/eks-connector/eks-connector-chart \
    --reuse-values \
    --set 'authentication.alloweduserarns={userarn1,userarn2}'

or, as the cluster administrator, grant the appropriate level of rbac privileges to individual kubernetes users.
for more information and examples, see grant access to view kubernetes cluster resources on an amazon eks console .

clusterrole example a clusterrole can be used to grant the same permissions as a role.
because clusterroles are cluster-scoped, you can also use them to grant access to: cluster-scoped resources (like nodes ) non-resource endpoints (like /healthz) namespaced resources (like pods), across all namespaces for example: you can use a clusterrole to allow a particular user to run

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

here is an example of a clusterrole that can be used to grant read access to secrets  in any particular namespace, or across all namespaces (depending on how it is bound ):

apiversion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: clusterrole
metadata:
  # ""namespace"" omitted since clusterroles are not namespaced
  name: secret-reader
rules:
- apigroups: [""""]
  #
  # at the http level, the name of the resource for accessing secret
  # objects is ""secrets""
  resources: [""secrets""]
  verbs: [""get"", ""watch"", ""list""]

the name of a role or a clusterrole object must be a valid path segment name .
rolebinding and clusterrolebinding a role binding grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users.
it holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference to the role being granted.
a rolebinding grants permissions within a specific namespace whereas a clusterrolebinding grants that access cluster-wide.
a rolebinding may reference any role in the same namespace.
alternatively, a rolebinding can reference a clusterrole and bind that clusterrole to the namespace of the rolebinding.
if you want to bind a clusterrole to all the namespaces in your cluster, you use a clusterrolebinding.
the name of a rolebinding or clusterrolebinding object must be a valid path segment name .
rolebinding examples here is an example of a rolebinding that grants the ""pod-reader"" role to the user ""jane"" within the ""default"" namespace.
this allows ""jane"" to read pods in the ""default"" namespace.

apiversion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# this role binding allows ""jane"" to read pods in the ""default"" namespace.
# you need to already have a role named ""pod-reader"" in that namespace.

# you can specify more than one ""subject""

  apigroup: rba the rbac api prevents users from escalating privileges by editing roles or role bindings.
because this is enforced at the api level, it applies even when the rbac authorizer is not in use.
restrictions on role creation or update you can only create/update a role if at least one of the following things is true: you already have all the permissions contained in the role, at the same scope as the object being modified (cluster-wide for a clusterrole, within the same namespace or cluster-wide for a role).
you are granted explicit permission to perform the escalate verb on the roles or clusterroles resource in the

rbac.authorization.k8s.io

api group.
for example, if user-1 does not have the ability to list secrets cluster-wide, they cannot create a clusterrole containing that permission.
to allow a user to create/update roles: grant them a role that allows them to create/update role or clusterrole objects, as desired.
grant them permission to include specific permissions in the roles they create/update: implicitly, by giving them those permissions (if they attempt to create or modify a role or clusterrole with permissions they themselves have not been granted, the api request will be forbidden) or explicitly allow specifying any permission in a role or clusterrole by giving them permission to perform the escalate verb on roles or clusterroles resources in the

rbac.authorization.k8s.io

api group restrictions on role binding creation or update you can only create/update a role binding if you already have all the permissions contained in the referenced role (at the same scope as the role binding) or if you have been authorized to perform the bind verb on the referenced role.
for example, if user-1 does not have the ability to list secrets cluster-wide, they cannot create a clusterrolebinding to a role that grants that permission.
to allow a user to create/update role bindings: grant them a role that allows them to create/update rolebinding or clusterrolebinding objects, as desired.
grant them permissions needed to bind a particular role: implicitly, by giving them the permissions contained in the role.
explicitly, by giving them permission to perform the bind verb on the particular role (or clusterrole).
for example, this clusterrole and rolebinding would allow user-1 to grant other users the admin, edit, and view roles in the namespace user-1-namespace:

when bootstrapping the first roles and role bindings, it is necessary for the initial user to grant permissions they do not yet have.
to bootstrap initial roles and role bindings: use a credential with the ""system:masters"" group, which is bound to the ""cluster-admin"" super-user role by the default bindings.
======================================== consider the following problem.
the amazon eks connector has successfully impersonated the requesting aws management console iam principal in the target kubernetes cluster.
however, the impersonated principal doesnât have rbac permission for kubernetes api operations.
to resolve this issue, there are two methods to give permissions to additional users.
if you previously installed eks-connector via helm chart, you can easily grant users access by running the following command.
replace the userarn1 and userarn2 with a list of the arns of the iam roles to give access to view the kubernetes resources:

helm upgrade eks-connector oci://public.ecr.aws/eks-connector/eks-connector-chart \
    --reuse-values \
    --set 'authentication.alloweduserarns={userarn1,userarn2}'

or, as the cluster administrator, grant the appropriate level of rbac privileges to individual kubernetes users.
for more information and examples, see grant access to view kubernetes cluster resources on an amazon eks console .

The output from the command above will show the name of the associated certificate request. You can further investigate by using the describe command again:

### Explanation
To list all certificates across all namespaces, you can use the command `kubectl get certificate --all-namespaces`. If you need to diagnose a specific certificate, the `kubectl describe certificate certificate_name -n your_namespace` command will provide detailed information, including the name of the associated certificate request. You can then further investigate that request with `kubectl describe certificaterequest certificate_request_name -n your_namespace`. 

For troubleshooting challenges, the command `kubectl describe challenges --all-namespaces` can be helpful. In my case, I found that changing from `clusterissuer` to `issuer` resolved my issue, as noted in the comment. The issuer manifest provided specifies the necessary details for ACME configuration, including the email for Let's Encrypt notifications and the challenge solver configuration. The ingress manifest outlines the setup for TLS and routing for the specified host.","certificatesigningrequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.

kubernetes v1.19 [stable]

a certificatesigningrequest  (csr) resource is used to request that a certificate be signed by a denoted signer, after which the request may be approved or denied before finally being signed.

the certificatesigningrequest object includes a pem-encoded pkcs#10 signing request in the

spec.request

field.
the certificatesigningrequest denotes the signer (the recipient that the request is being made to) using the

spec.signername

field.
note that

spec.signername

is a required key after api version

certificates.k8s.io/v1

.
in kubernetes v1.22 and later, clients may optionally set the

spec.expirationseconds

field to request a particular lifetime for the issued certificate.
the minimum valid value for this field is 600, i.e.
ten minutes.
once created, a certificatesigningrequest must be approved before it can be signed.
depending on the signer selected, a certificatesigningrequest may be automatically approved by a controller .
otherwise, a certificatesigningrequest must be manually approved either via the rest api (or client-go) or by running

kubectl certificate approve

.
likewise, a certificatesigningrequest may also be denied, which tells the configured signer that it must not sign the request.
for certificates that have been approved, the next step is signing.
the relevant signing controller first validates that the signing conditions are met and then creates a certificate.
the signing controller then updates the certificatesigningrequest, storing the new certificate into the

status.certificate

field of the existing certificatesigningrequest object.
the

status.certificate

field is either empty or contains a x.509 certificate, encoded in pem format.
the certificatesigningrequest

status.certificate

field is empty until the signer does this.
once the

status.certificate

field has been populated, the request has been completed and clients can now fetch the signed certificate pem data from the certificatesigningrequest resource.
the signers can instead deny certificate signing if the approval conditions are not met.
in order to reduce the number of old certificatesigningrequest resources left in a cluster, a garbage collection controller runs periodically.
the garbage collection removes certificatesigningrequests that have not changed state for some duration: approved requests: automatically deleted after 1 hour denied requests: automatically deleted after 1 hour failed requests: automatically deleted after 1 hour pending requests: automatically deleted after 24 hours all requests: automatically deleted after the issued certificate has expired certificate signing authorization to allow creating a certificatesigningrequest and retrieving any certificatesigningrequest: verbs: create, get, list, watch, group:

the controller-manager performs this function via a certificate-issuing control loop.
this takes the form of a cfssl  local signer using assets on disk.
currently, all certificates issued have one year validity and a default set of key usages.
in order for the controller-manager to sign certificates, it needs the following: access to the ""kubernetes ca key and certificate"" that you created and distributed enabling csr signing access to key and certificate as described earlier, you need to create a kubernetes ca key and certificate, and distribute it to the control plane nodes.
these will be used by the controller-manager to sign the kubelet certificates.
since these signed certificates will, in turn, be used by the kubelet to authenticate as a regular kubelet to kube-apiserver, it is important that the ca provided to the controller-manager at this stage also be trusted by kube-apiserver for authentication.
this is provided to kube-apiserver with the flag --client-ca-file=filename (for example,

--client-ca-file=/var/lib/kubernetes/ca.pem

), as described in the kube-apiserver configuration section.
to provide the kubernetes ca key and certificate to kube-controller-manager, use the following flags:

--cluster-signing-cert-file=""/etc/path/to/kubernetes/ca/ca.crt"" --cluster-signing-key-file=""/etc/path/to/kubernetes/ca/ca.key""

for example:

--cluster-signing-cert-file=""/var/lib/kubernetes/ca.pem"" --cluster-signing-key-file=""/var/lib/kubernetes/ca-key.pem""

the validity duration of signed certificates can be configured with flag: --cluster-signing-duration approval in order to approve csrs, you need to tell the controller-manager that it is acceptable to approve them.
this is done by granting rbac permissions to the correct group.
there are two distinct sets of permissions: nodeclient: if a node is creating a new certificate for a node, then it does not have a certificate yet.
it is authenticating using one of the tokens listed above, and thus is part of the group system:bootstrappers.
selfnodeclient: if a node is renewing its certificate, then it already has a certificate (by definition), which it uses continuously to authenticate as part of the group system:nodes.
to enable the kubelet to request and receive a new certificate, create a clusterrolebinding that binds the group in which the bootstrapping node is a member system:bootstrappers to the clusterrole that grants it permission,

system:certificates.k8s.io:certificatesigningrequests:nodeclient

the signers can instead deny certificate signing if the approval conditions are not met.

the garbage collection removes certificatesigningrequests that have not changed state for some duration: approved requests: automatically deleted after 1 hour denied requests: automatically deleted after 1 hour failed requests: automatically deleted after 1 hour pending requests: automatically deleted after 24 hours all requests: automatically deleted after the issued certificate has expired certificate signing authorization to allow creating a certificatesigningrequest and retrieving any certificatesigningrequest: verbs: create, get, list, watch, group:

  - watch while the apiserver receives the requests for certificates from the kubelet and authenticates those requests, the controller-manager is responsible for issuing actual signed certificates.
the controller-manager performs this function via a certificate-issuing control loop.
this takes the form of a cfssl  local signer using assets on disk.
currently, all certificates issued have one year validity and a default set of key usages.
in order for the controller-manager to sign certificates, it needs the following: access to the ""kubernetes ca key and certificate"" that you created and distributed enabling csr signing access to key and certificate as described earlier, you need to create a kubernetes ca key and certificate, and distribute it to the control plane nodes.
these will be used by the controller-manager to sign the kubelet certificates.
since these signed certificates will, in turn, be used by the kubelet to authenticate as a regular kubelet to kube-apiserver, it is important that the ca provided to the controller-manager at this stage also be trusted by kube-apiserver for authentication.
this is provided to kube-apiserver with the flag --client-ca-file=filename (for example,

--client-ca-file=/var/lib/kubernetes/ca.pem

), as described in the kube-apiserver configuration section.
to provide the kubernetes ca key and certificate to kube-controller-manager, use the following flags:

--cluster-signing-cert-file=""/etc/path/to/kubernetes/ca/ca.crt"" --cluster-signing-key-file=""/etc/path/to/kubernetes/ca/ca.key""

for example:

--cluster-signing-cert-file=""/var/lib/kubernetes/ca.pem"" --cluster-signing-key-file=""/var/lib/kubernetes/ca-key.pem""

the validity duration of signed certificates can be configured with flag: --cluster-signing-duration approval in order to approve csrs, you need to tell the controller-manager that it is acceptable to approve them.
this is done by granting rbac permissions to the correct group.
there are two distinct sets of permissions: nodeclient: if a node is creating a new certificate for a node, then it does not have a certificate yet.
it is authenticating using one of the tokens listed above, and thus is part of the group system:bootstrappers.
selfnodeclient: if a node is renewing its certificate, then it already has a certificate (by definition), which it uses continuously to authenticate as part of the group system:nodes.
to enable the kubelet to request and receive a new certificate, create a clusterrolebinding that binds the group in which the bootstrapping node is a member system:bootstrappers to the clusterrole that grants it permission,

system:certificates.k8s.io:certificatesigningrequests:nodeclient

```
### Explanation
StatefulSets do indeed support `imagePullSecrets`. You can verify this by running the following command:
```bash
$ kubectl explain statefulset.spec.template.spec --api-version apps/v1
```
This will show you that `imagePullSecrets` is an optional list of references to secrets within the same namespace that can be used for pulling images specified in the pod template. If provided, these secrets will be utilized by the image puller implementations. For instance, only Docker config type secrets are recognized in the case of Docker. For more details, you can refer to the Kubernetes documentation: [Specifying imagePullSecrets on a Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod).

To test this, you can create a sample StatefulSet in your cluster using the following command:
```bash
$ kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: ""nginx""
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: your-pull-secret-name
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
EOF
```

After creating the StatefulSet, you can check if the pod has the specified `imagePullSecrets` by running:
```bash
$ kubectl get pod web-0 -o yaml | grep -e '^[[:space:]]+imagePullSecrets:' -A1
```
This should show you the `imagePullSecrets` configuration for the pod.","image pull secrets are essentially a combination of  registry ,  username , and
 password . you may need them in an application you are deploying, but to
create them requires running  base64  a couple of times. we can write a helper
template to compose the docker configuration file for use as the secret's
payload. here is an example:first, assume that the credentials are defined in the  values.yaml  file like
so:imagecredentials : 
    registry :   quay.io 
    username :   someone 
    password :   sillyness

to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .

using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.

if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.

### Explanation
I eventually figured this out, so for anyone else who might come across this post, here's how I resolved the issue: The key was to avoid relying on merging between the ingress objects. While it can handle some level of merging, there isn't a direct one-to-one relationship between services as target groups and ingress as ALB. Therefore, it's essential to be cautious and aware of the contents of each ingress object. 

Once I consolidated all my ingress configurations into a single object definition, I was able to achieve the desired functionality. The default action is set by specifying the service name and service port directly under the `spec`. Since I am using subdomains and paths won't work for my use case, I omitted the path and instead relied on the hostname as a condition. 

The end result was that the ALB rules were configured exactly as I wanted: the default action returns a 503 fixed response, all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS, and traffic is directed to target groups based on the host header.","you can share an application load balancer across multiple service resources using ingressgroups.
to join an ingress to a group, add the following annotation to a kubernetes ingress resource specification.

alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: my-group

the group name must: be 63 or fewer characters in length.
consist of lower case letters, numbers, -, and

.

start and end with a letter or number.
the controller automatically merges ingress rules for all ingresses in the same ingress group.
it supports them with a single alb.
most annotations that are defined on an ingress only apply to the paths defined by that ingress.
by default, ingress resources donât belong to any ingress group.
warning potential security risk specify an ingress group for an ingress only when all the kubernetes users that have rbac permission to create or modify ingress resources are within the same trust boundary.
if you add the annotation with a group name, other kubernetes users might create or modify their ingresses to belong to the same ingress group.
doing so can cause undesirable behavior, such as overwriting existing rules with higher priority rules.
you can add an order number of your ingress resource.

alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.order: '10'

the number can be 1-1000.
the lowest number for all ingresses in the same ingress group is evaluated first.
all ingresses without this annotation are evaluated with a value of zero.
duplicate rules with a higher number can overwrite rules with a lower number.
by default, the rule order between ingresses within the same ingress group is determined lexicographically based namespace and name.
important ensure that each ingress in the same ingress group has a unique priority number.
you canât have duplicate order numbers across ingresses.
========================================","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:

  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /

            name: test
            port:
              number: 80

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

            path","ingress backed by a single service there are existing kubernetes concepts that allow you to expose a single service (see alternatives ).
you can also do this with an ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.

        number: 80

if you create it using

kubectl apply -f

you should be able to view the state of the ingress you added:

kubectl get ingress test-ingress



name           class         hosts   address         ports   age
test-ingress   external-lb   *       203.0.113.123   80      59s

where

203.0.113.123

is the ip allocated by the ingress controller to satisfy this ingress.
note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.
an ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.
for example, a setup like:  figure.
ingress fan out it would require an ingress such as: service/networking/simple-fanout-example.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1

when you create the ingress with

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.
 figure.
ingress name based virtual hosting the following ingress tells the backing load balancer to route requests based on the host header .

            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

second.bar.com

to service2, and any traffic whose re","you can share an application load balancer across multiple service resources using ingressgroups.

### Explanation
I have successfully replicated your scenario in my lab, and after making a few adjustments to your Ingress configuration, it is functioning as you described. In my setup, I utilized an NGINX image that serves a default landing page on port 80. With the provided Ingress rule, it is possible to access this page on both ports 80 and 443. 

The only modification I made to your Ingress was the removal of the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: false`, as it is stated in the documentation that SSL passthrough is disabled by default, making this specification unnecessary.

I also used the same TLS secret as you did, created with the following commands:
```bash
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj ""/cn=nginxsvc/o=nginxsvc""
$ kubectl create secret tls tls-secret --key tls.key --cert tls.crt
```

In your inquiry, it seems you are attempting to access your Ingress using the IP address 192.168.0.210, which is actually the service IP and not the Ingress IP. If you are using a cloud-managed Kubernetes service, you can find your Ingress IP by running:
```bash
$ kubectl get ingresses nginx
```

If you are operating on bare metal without a load balancer solution like MetalLB, you may notice that your Ingress-NGINX service will have an external IP status of ""pending"" indefinitely. You can manually assign an external IP to your Ingress-NGINX service similar to how you did with your service:
```bash
$ kubectl get service -n ingress-nginx
```

After making this change, your Ingress will reflect the same IP as defined in your Ingress service:
```bash
$ kubectl get ingress nginx
```

You can then test the Ingress with:
```bash
$ curl -kl https://<your-ingress-ip>/nginx --verbose
```

Lastly, it appears that there is no direct method to manually set the ""external IPs"" for the Ingress as you can for the service. If you have any insights on this, please share. For production environments, MetalLB would be the optimal choice. If this is for a lab setup, you can add your node's public IP (which you can obtain by running `kubectl get nodes -o wide`) to your NGINX Ingress controller by modifying the spec:
```yaml
spec:
  externalIPs:
  - 192.168.0.210
```

Create a file named `ingress-nginx-svc-patch.yaml` with the above content and apply the changes using:
```bash
kubectl patch service ingress-nginx-controller -n kube-system --patch ""$(cat ingress-nginx-svc-patch.yaml)""
```

As a result, you should see:
```bash
$ kubectl get service -n kube-system ingress-nginx-controller
```","till now we have only accessed the nginx server from within the cluster.
before exposing the service to the internet, you want to make sure the communication channel is secure.
for this, you will need: self signed certificates for https (unless you already have an identity certificate) an nginx server configured to use the certificates a secret  that makes the certificates accessible to pods you can acquire all these from the nginx https example .
this requires having go and make tools installed.
if you don't want to install those, then follow the manual steps later.
in short:

make keys key=/tmp/nginx.key cert=/tmp/nginx.crt
kubectl create secret tls nginxsecret --key /tmp/nginx.key --cert /tmp/nginx.crt

secret/nginxsecret created

kubectl get secrets

nginxsecret           kubernetes.io/tls                     2         1m

and also the configmap:

kubectl create configmap nginxconfigmap --from-file=default.conf

you can find an example for

in the kubernetes examples project repo .

kubectl get configmaps

nginxconfigmap   1      114s

you can view the details of the nginxconfigmap configmap using the following command:

kubectl describe configmap  nginxconfigmap

note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.
an ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.
for example, a setup like:  figure.
ingress fan out it would require an ingress such as: service/networking/simple-fanout-example.yaml

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.
 figure.
ingress name based virtual hosting the following ingress tells the backing load balancer to route requests based on the host header .
service/networking/name-virtual-host-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1

  name: name-virtual-host-ingress

            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

second.bar.com

to service2, and any traffic whose re","till now we have only accessed the nginx server from within the cluster.
before exposing the service to the internet, you want to make sure the communication channel is secure.
for this, you will need: self signed certificates for https (unless you already have an identity certificate) an nginx server configured to use the certificates a secret  that makes the certificates accessible to pods you can acquire all these from the nginx https example .
this requires having go and make tools installed.
if you don't want to install those, then follow the manual steps later.
in short:

make keys key=/tmp/nginx.key cert=/tmp/nginx.crt
kubectl create secret tls nginxsecret --key /tmp/nginx.key --cert /tmp/nginx.crt

secret/nginxsecret created

kubectl get secrets

nginxsecret           kubernetes.io/tls                     2         1m

and also the configmap:

kubectl create configmap nginxconfigmap --from-file=default.conf

you can find an example for

default.conf

in the kubernetes examples project repo .
configmap/nginxconfigmap created

kubectl get configmaps



name             data   age
nginxconfigmap   1      114s

you can view the details of the nginxconfigmap configmap using the following command:

kubectl describe configmap  nginxconfigmap

the output is similar to:

### Explanation
To troubleshoot the 404 error you are encountering, you can examine the logs of the nginx-ingress controller pod. Use the following command to retrieve the logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx ingress_nginx_controller_pod_name
```

The output will resemble the following (depending on your specific use case):

```
client_ip - - [12/May/2020:11:06:56 +0000] ""GET / HTTP/1.1"" 200 238 ""-"" ""redacted"" 430 0.003 [default-ubuntu-service-ubuntu-port] [] 10.48.0.13:8080 276 0.003 200
client_ip - - [12/May/2020:11:06:56 +0000] ""GET /assets/styles/style.css HTTP/1.1"" 200 22 ""http://server_ip/"" ""redacted"" 348 0.002 [default-ubuntu-service-ubuntu-port] [] 10.48.0.13:8080 22 0.002 200
```

These logs will help you determine if the requests are being processed correctly by the nginx-ingress controller and where they are being directed. Additionally, you can refer to the documentation at kubernetes.github.io: ingress-nginx: ingress-path-matching, which explains how ingress matches paths using regular expressions.

You can also experiment with ingress by following the steps below:

1. Deploy the nginx-ingress controller.
2. Create a pod and a service.
3. Run an example application.
4. Create an ingress resource.
5. Test the setup.
6. Rewrite the example as needed.

To deploy the nginx-ingress controller, follow the official documentation available at kubernetes.github.io: ingress-nginx.

For testing purposes, here is an example definition of a pod and a service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ubuntu
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ubuntu
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ubuntu
        image: ubuntu
        command:
        - sleep
        - ""infinity""
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: ubuntu
  ports:
    - name: ubuntu-port
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30080
  type: NodePort
```

Next, create a basic `index.html` file along with a CSS file to simulate the request process. You can create these files inside the pod or copy them over. The file structure should look like this:

```
index.html
assets/styles/style.css
```

The content of `index.html` should be:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang=""en"">
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">
  <meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"">
  <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""assets/styles/style.css"">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hi</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Pay special attention to the line:

```html
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""assets/styles/style.css"">
```

The `style.css` file should contain:

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

You can run the above page using Python:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y python3
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Now, create an ingress resource configured to use the nginx-ingress controller:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress-example
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  rules:
  - host: 
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: ubuntu-service
            port:
              name: ubuntu-port
```

After applying the above resource, you can start testing. Access the external IP address associated with your ingress resource in your browser. As mentioned earlier, you can check the logs of the nginx-ingress controller pod to see how it handles requests.

If you run the command `python3 -m http.server 8080`, you will also see logs like:

```
10.48.0.16 - - [12/May/2020 11:06:56] ""GET / HTTP/1.1"" 200 -
10.48.0.16 - - [12/May/2020 11:06:56] ""GET /assets/styles/style.css HTTP/1.1"" 200 -
```

For a path rewrite example, you can modify the ingress resource as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress-example
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
spec:
  rules:
  - host: 
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /product/(.*)
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: ubuntu-service
            port:
              name: ubuntu-port
```

The changes made include:

- Adding the annotation for the rewrite target: `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1`
- Modifying the path to: `/product/(.*)`

In this scenario, when the browser sends a request to `/product/`, the controller rewrites it to `/`, and the pod receives the request as `/`. 

Logs from the nginx-ingress controller will show:

```
client_ip - - [12/May/2020:11:33:23 +0000] ""GET /product/ HTTP/1.1"" 200 228 ""-"" ""redacted"" 438 0.002 [default-ubuntu-service-ubuntu-port] [] 10.48.0.13:8080 276 0.001 200
client_ip - - [12/May/2020:11:33:23 +0000] ""GET /product/assets/styles/style.css HTTP/1.1"" 200 22 ""http://server_ip/product/"" ""redacted"" 364 0.002 [default-ubuntu-service-ubuntu-port] [] 10.48.0.13:8080 22 0.002 200
```

And the logs from the pod will show:

```
10.48.0.16 - - [12/May/2020 11:33:23] ""GET / HTTP/1.1"" 200 -
10.48.0.16 - - [12/May/2020 11:33:23] ""GET /assets/styles/style.css HTTP/1.1"" 200 -
```

3. **Remediation**: The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation is now set to rewrite requests from `/product/console/` to `/product/static/`, capturing the rest of the path.
4. **Validation**: The YAML syntax is corrected, and the `pathType` is specified to ensure proper path matching. The `apiVersion` is updated to `networking.k8s.io/v1` for compatibility with newer Kubernetes versions.","```yaml

### Explanation
I appreciate you updating your question with an example. The solution I provided earlier remains valid for sharing a replacement configuration across multiple overlays. However, there are some inaccuracies in your replacement syntax: you cannot directly target `spec.template.spec.volumes.name` because `volumes` is a list and does not have a name attribute. Instead, you should use a selector in the `[name=value]` format to target list elements, like this:

```yaml
replacements:
  - source:
      name: test_secret
      kind: Secret
    targets:
      - select:
          kind: Deployment
          name: service
        fieldPaths:
          - spec.template.spec.volumes.[name=placeholder_value].name
```

A `kustomization.yaml` can only apply transformations (such as labels, patches, and replacements) to resources that it generates. Therefore, if you want a transformation to affect all resources, it must be applied in the ""outermost"" kustomization. This means you cannot place something in a ""base"" that will modify resources created in your overlays. 

However, there's no need to worry; components allow you to reuse kustomization fragments. By moving your replacement configuration into a component, you can achieve the desired behavior. For instance, consider a project structure with a base and two overlays:

```
.
├── base
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   └── kustomization.yaml
├── components
│   └── replace-username-password
│       └── kustomization.yaml
└── overlay
    ├── env1
    │   └── kustomization.yaml
    └── env2
        └── kustomization.yaml
```

The `base/deployment.yaml` file looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  replicas: 2
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: example
          image: docker.io/alpine:latest
          command:
            - sleep
            - inf
          env:
            - name: user_name
              value: update-via-replacement
            - name: user_password
              value: update-via-replacement
```

And the `base/kustomization.yaml` file is structured as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
commonLabels:
  app: replacement-example

resources:
  - deployment.yaml

secretGenerator:
  - name: example
    literals:
      - password=secret

configMapGenerator:
  - name: example
    literals:
      - username=alice
```

This base directory results in a deployment, a secret, and a config map. In both overlays, `env1` and `env2`, I want to apply the same replacement configuration, so I place that in `components/replace-username-password/kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component

replacements:
  - source:
      kind: ConfigMap
      name: example
      fieldPath: data.username
    targets:
      - select:
          kind: Deployment
          name: example
        fieldPaths:
          - spec.template.spec.containers.[name=example].env.[name=user_name].value
  - source:
      kind: Secret
      name: example
      fieldPath: data.password
    targets:
      - select:
          kind: Deployment
          name: example
        fieldPaths:
          - spec.template.spec.containers.[name=example].env.[name=user_password].value
```

Now, in `overlays/env1/kustomization.yaml`, I can utilize this component:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
commonLabels:
  envName: env1

resources:
  - ../../base

components:
  - ../../components/replace-username-password
```

The same applies to `overlays/env2/kustomization.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
commonLabels:
  envName: env2

resources:
  - ../../base

components:
  - ../../components/replace-username-password
```","kustomize is a tool for customizing kubernetes configurations.
it has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.
the source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:
  - .env
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;deployment.yaml

configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

generate the configmap and deployment:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated deployment will refer to the generated configmap by name:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: e","kustomize has the concepts of bases and overlays .
a base is a directory with a

kustomization.yaml

, which contains a set of resources and associated customization.
a base could be either a local directory or a directory from a remote repo, as long as a

kustomization.yaml

is present inside.
an overlay is a directory with a

kustomization.yaml

that refers to other kustomization directories as its bases.
a base has no knowledge of an overlay and can be used in multiple overlays.
the

kustomization.yaml

in an overlay directory may refer to multiple bases, combining all the resources defined in these bases into a unified configuration.
additionally, it can apply customizations on top of these resources to meet specific requirements.
here is an example of a base:

# create a directory to hold the base
mkdir base
# create a base/deployment.yaml

this base can be used in multiple overlays.
you can add different nameprefix or other cross-cutting fields in different overlays.
here are two overlays using the same base.

### Explanation:
1. **Indentation and Formatting**: The `indent` function is used to ensure proper YAML formatting for the environment variables.
2. **Accessing Service Name**: The service name is accessed using `$key` to correctly reference each service in the loop.
3. **Correct Field Names**: Ensure that `apiVersion` and `containerPort` are correctly spelled with the right casing.

This should resolve the formatting issues and generate the expected output for each service defined in your `values.yaml`.","```yaml

        {{- end }}
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: myregistry
{{- end }}
```

### Improvements Made:
1. **Corrected `apiVersion`**: Changed from `apps/v1beta1` to `apps/v1`, which is the stable version for Deployments.
2. **Added `selector`**: Included a `selector` field to specify how the Deployment finds which Pods to manage, which is required in `apps/v1`.
3. **Consistent Indentation**: Ensured that the indentation is consistent for better readability and to avoid YAML parsing errors.

This configuration should now be fully aligned with Kubernetes best practices and the requirements for a Deployment resource.","3602.0, 3463.0, 3571.0"

### Explanation
When you examine the output of `kubectl describe service`, you'll notice that it isn't linked to any pods:

```
endpoints:              <none>
```

This occurs because the service specification indicates that it should connect to pods labeled with `app: tcserver`:

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    app: tcserver
```

However, in the pod specification's metadata, you haven't defined any labels:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: tcserver
  namespace: default
  # labels: {}
```

To resolve this issue, you need to add the appropriate label to the pod specification:

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app: tcserver
```

It's also worth mentioning that deploying a standalone pod is somewhat uncommon. Typically, pods are managed by a higher-level controller, most frequently a deployment, which is responsible for creating the pods. The deployment specification includes a template for the pod specification, and it's the labels on the pod that are significant for the service.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tcserver
  # labels here are useful, but the service doesn't look for them
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        # these labels are what the service cares about
        app: tcserver
    spec:
      containers: [...]
```","it might sound silly, but you should really double and triple check that your service is correct and matches your pod's port.
read back your service and verify it:

kubectl get service hostnames -o json

is the service port you are trying to access listed in

spec.ports[]

? is the targetport correct for your pods (some pods use a different port than the service)? if you meant to use a numeric port, is it a number (9376) or a string ""9376""? if you meant to use a named port, do your pods expose a port with the same name? is the port's protocol correct for your pods? ========================================","packets sent to services with type=nodeport  are source nat'd by default.
you can test this by creating a nodeport service:

kubectl expose deployment source-ip-app --name=nodeport --port=80 --target-port=8080 --type=nodeport

the output is: service/nodeport exposed

nodeport=$(kubectl get -o jsonpath=""{.spec.ports[0].nodeport}"" services nodeport)
nodes=$(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{ $.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type==""internalip"")].address }')

if you're running on a cloud provider, you may need to open up a firewall-rule for the nodes:nodeport reported above.
now you can try reaching the service from outside the cluster through the node port allocated above.

for node in $nodes; do curl -s $node:$nodeport | grep -i client_address; done

the output is similar to:

client_address=10.180.1.1
client_address=10.240.0.5
client_address=10.240.0.3

note that these are not the correct client ips, they're cluster internal ips.
this is what happens: client sends packet to node2:nodeport node2 replaces the source ip address (snat) in the packet with its own ip address node2 replaces the destination ip on the packet with the pod ip packet is routed to node 1, and then to the endpoint the pod's reply is routed back to node2 the pod's reply is sent back to the client visually:  figure.
source ip type=nodeport using snat to avoid this, kubernetes has a feature to preserve the client source ip .
if you set

service.spec.externaltrafficpolicy

to the value local, kube-proxy only proxies proxy requests to local endpoints, and does not forward traffic to other nodes.
this approach preserves the original source ip address.
if there are no local endpoints, packets sent to the node are dropped, so you can rely on the correct source-ip in any packet processing rules you might apply a packet that make it through to the endpoint.
set the

service.spec.externaltrafficpolicy

field as follows:

kubectl patch svc nodeport -p '{""spec"":{""externaltrafficpolicy"":""local""}}'

the output is: service/nodeport patched now, re-run the test:

for node in $nodes; do curl --connect-timeout 1 -s $node:$nodeport | grep -i client_address; done

the output is similar to:

client_address=198.51.100.79

note that you only got one reply, with the right client ip, from the one node on which the endpoint pod is running.
this is what happens: client sends packet to node2:nodeport, which doesn't have any endpoints packet is dropped client sends packet to node1:nodeport, which does have endpoints node1 routes packet to endpoint with the correct source ip visually: figure.
source ip type=nodeport preserves client source ip address ========================================","a service is an object  (the same way that a pod or a configmap is an object).
you can create, view or modify service definitions using the kubernetes api.
usually you use a tool such as kubectl to make those api calls for you.
for example, suppose you have a set of pods that each listen on tcp port 9376 and are labelled as

app.kubernetes.io/name=myapp

.
you can define a service to publish that tcp listener: service/simple-service.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: tcp
      port: 80
      targetport: 9376

applying this manifest creates a new service named ""my-service"" with the default clusterip service type .
the service targets tcp port 9376 on any pod with the

app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp

label.
kubernetes assigns this service an ip address (the cluster ip ), that is used by the virtual ip address mechanism.
for more details on that mechanism, read virtual ips and service proxies .
the controller for that service continuously scans for pods that match its selector, and then makes any necessary updates to the set of endpointslices for the service.
the name of a service object must be a valid rfc 1035 label name .
note: a service can map any incoming port to a targetport.
by default and for convenience, the targetport is set to the same value as the port field.
port definitions port definitions in pods have names, and you can reference these names in the targetport attribute of a service.
for example, we can bind the targetport of the service to the pod port in the following way:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - containerport: 80
        name: http-web-svc

---
apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
  ports:
  - name: name-of-service-port
    protocol: tcp
    port: 80
    targetport: http-web-svc

this works even if there is a mixture of pods in the service using a single configured name, with the same network protocol available via different port numbers.
this offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving your services.
for example, you can change the port numbers that pods expose in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.
the default protocol for services is tcp ; you can also use any other supported protocol .
because many services need to expose more than one port, kubernetes supports multiple port definitions  for a single service.
each port definition can have the same protocol, or a different one.
services without selectors services most commonly abstract access to kubernetes pods thanks to the selector, but when used with a corresponding set of endpointslices  objects and without a selector, the service can abstract other kinds of backends, including ones that run outside the cluster.
for example: you want to have an external database cluster in production, but in your test environment you use your own databases.
you want to point your service to a service in a different namespace  or on another cluster.
you are migrating a workload to kubernetes.
while evaluating the approach, you run only a portion of your backends in kubernetes.
in any of these scenarios you can define a service without specifying a selector to match pods.
for example:

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: tcp
      port: 80
      targetport: 9376

because this service has no selector, the corresponding endpointslice (and legacy endpoints) objects are not created automatically.
you can map the service to the network address and port where it's running, by adding an endpointslice object manually.
for example:

apiversion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: endpointslice
metadata:
  name: my-service-1 # by convention, use the name ","it might sound silly, but you should really double and triple check that your service is correct and matches your pod's port.
read back your service and verify it:

kubectl get service hostnames -o json

        }
    },
    ""spec"": {
        ""ports"": [

                ""targetport"": 9376,
                ""nodeport"": 0
            }
        ],
        ""selector"": {
            ""app"": ""hostnames""

### Explanation:
The issue arises because the Service's selector does not match any Pods. The selector `app: tcserver` in the Service configuration must match the labels of the Pods. In your Pod YAML, you have not defined any labels. To fix this, add the label `app: tcserver` to your Pod definition. 

Here’s the corrected Pod YAML:

```yaml
apiversion: v1

### Explanation
To properly configure your ingress, you need to utilize a regular expression capture group in your path definition and reference that group in the `.../rewrite-target` annotation. In the provided example, the first rule captures the entire path in group `$2`, while group `$1` remains empty since it is not needed. For the second rule, we ensure that the path starts with `/mf2` and is followed by either a `/` or the end of the URL, preventing incorrect matches like `/mf2something`. In this case, group `$1` captures the `/` (or nothing), and the desired path is captured in `$2`. Consequently, the rewritten path (`/$2`) will yield the expected result.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","official document: !!!

### Explanation:
The provided Ingress configuration is set up to route traffic to two different services based on the request path. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation is correctly configured to rewrite the URL for requests to the `mf2` service, capturing any additional path segments after `/mf2`. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex` annotation is enabled to allow regex matching for the path. 

This configuration ensures that requests to `/mf2` and its sub-paths are directed to the `mf2` service, while all other requests are routed to the `mf1` service. This setup aligns with best practices for using Ingress in Kubernetes to manage traffic to multiple services.","3397.0, 3417.0, 3389.0"

### Explanation
After updating the Kubernetes service template to include `sessionAffinity: ClientIP`, it is functioning correctly now. However, I encountered an error when I first pressed Ctrl + F5, which resulted in a WebSocket handshake error with the message: ""unexpected response code: 400."" On the second attempt, it worked fine. Despite this initial error, I am still receiving data from the server, so I believe the setup is generally okay.","till now we have only accessed the nginx server from within the cluster.
before exposing the service to the internet, you want to make sure the communication channel is secure.
for this, you will need: self signed certificates for https (unless you already have an identity certificate) an nginx server configured to use the certificates a secret  that makes the certificates accessible to pods you can acquire all these from the nginx https example .
this requires having go and make tools installed.
if you don't want to install those, then follow the manual steps later.
in short:

make keys key=/tmp/nginx.key cert=/tmp/nginx.crt
kubectl create secret tls nginxsecret --key /tmp/nginx.key --cert /tmp/nginx.crt

secret/nginxsecret created

kubectl get secrets



name                  type                                  data      age
nginxsecret           kubernetes.io/tls                     2         1m

and also the configmap:

kubectl create configmap nginxconfigmap --from-file=default.conf

you can find an example for

default.conf

in the kubernetes examples project repo .
configmap/nginxconfigmap created

kubectl get configmaps



name             data   age
nginxconfigmap   1      114s

you can view the details of the nginxconfigmap configmap using the following command:

kubectl describe configmap  nginxconfigmap

the output is similar to:

name:         nginxconfigmap
namespace:    default
labels:       &lt;none&gt;
annotations:  &lt;none&gt;

following are the manual steps to follow in case you run into problems running make (on windows for example):

# create a public private key pair
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /d/tmp/nginx.key -out /d/tmp/nginx.crt -subj ""/cn=my-nginx/o=my-nginx""
# convert the keys to base64 encoding
cat /d/tmp/nginx.crt | base64
cat /d/tmp/nginx.key | base64

use the output from the previous commands to create a yaml file as follows.
the base64 encoded value should all be on a single line.

for example, the pod might request more resources than are free on any node, or it might specify a label selector that doesn't match any nodes.
let's say we created the previous deployment with 5 replicas (instead of 2) and requesting 600 millicores instead of 500, on a four-node cluster where each (virtual) machine has 1 cpu.
in that case one of the pods will not be able to schedule.
(note that because of the cluster addon pods such as fluentd, skydns, etc., that run on each node, if we requested 1000 millicores then none of the pods would be able to schedule.)

kubectl get pods



name                                ready     status    restarts   age

nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd   0/1       pending   0          1m

to find out why the nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd pod is not running, we can use

kubectl describe pod

on the pending pod and look at its events:

kubectl describe pod nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd



name:		nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd
  namespace:	default
  node:		/

  fit failure on node (kubernetes-node-wul5): node didn't have enough resource: cpu, requested: 1000, used: 1100, capacity: 2000

here you can see the event generated by the scheduler saying that the pod failed to schedule for reason failedscheduling (and possibly others).
the message tells us that there were not enough resources for the pod on any of the nodes.
to correct this situation, you can use kubectl scale to update your deployment to specify four or fewer replicas.
(or you could leave the one pod pending, which is harmless.) events such as the ones you saw at the end of

kubectl describe pod

are persisted in etcd and provide high-level information on what is happening in the cluster.
to list all events you can use

kubectl get events

but you have to remember that events are namespaced.
this means that if you're interested in events for some namespaced object (e.g.
what happened with pods in namespace my-namespace) you need to explicitly provide a namespace to the command:

kubectl get events --namespace=my-namespace

to see events from all namespaces, you can use the --all-namespaces argument.
in addition to

kubectl describe pod

, another way to get extra information about a pod (beyond what is provided by

kubectl get pod

) is to pass the -o yaml output format flag to

kubectl get pod

.
this will give you, in yaml format, even more information than

kubectl describe pod

--essentially all of the information the system has about the pod.
here you will see things like annotations (which are key-value metadata without the label restrictions, that is used internally by kubernete","here is the configuration file for the application deployment: service/access/hello-application.yaml 

apiversion: apps/v1

          ports:
            - containerport: 8080
              protocol: tcp

run a hello world application in your cluster: create the application deployment using the file above:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/service/access/hello-application.yaml

the preceding command creates a deployment  and an associated replicaset .
the replicaset has two pods  each of which runs the hello world application.
display information about the deployment:

kubectl get deployments hello-world
kubectl describe deployments hello-world

display information about your replicaset objects:

kubectl get replicasets
kubectl describe replicasets

create a service object that exposes the deployment:

kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=nodeport --name=example-service

display information about the service:

kubectl describe services example-service

the output is similar to this:

name:                   example-service
namespace:              default
labels:                 run=load-balancer-example
annotations:            &lt;none&gt;
selector:               run=load-balancer-example
type:                   nodeport
ip:                     10.32.0.16
port:                   &lt;unset&gt; 8080/tcp
targetport:             8080/tcp
nodeport:               &lt;unset&gt; 31496/tcp

session affinity:       none
events:                 &lt;none&gt;

make a note of the nodeport value for the service.
for example, in the preceding output, the nodeport value is 31496.
list the pods that are running the hello world application:

kubectl get pods --selector=""run=load-balancer-example"" --output=wide

the output is similar to this:

name                           ready   status    ...  ip           node
hello-world-2895499144-bsbk5   1/1     running   ...  10.200.1.4   worker1
hello-world-2895499144-m1pwt   1/1     running   ...  10.200.2.5   worker2

get the public ip address of one of your nodes that is running a hello world pod.
how you get this address depends on how you set up your cluster.
for example, if you are using minikube, you can see the node address by running kubectl cluster-info.
if you are using google compute engine instances, you can use the

gcloud compute instances list

command to see the public addresses of your nodes.
on your chosen node, create a firewall rule that allows tcp traffic on your node port.
for example, if your service has a nodeport value of 31568, create a firewall rule that allows tcp traffic on port 31568.
different cloud providers offer different ways of configuring firewall rules.
use the node address and node port to access the hello world application: curl http://<public-node-ip>:<node-port> where <public-node-ip> is the public ip address of your node, and <node-port> is the nodeport value for your service.
the response to a successful request is a hello message:

hello, world!
version: 2.0.0
hostname: hello-world-cdd4458f4-m47c8

========================================","till now we have only accessed the nginx server from within the cluster.
before exposing the service to the internet, you want to make sure the communication channel is secure.
for this, you will need: self signed certificates for https (unless you already have an identity certificate) an nginx server configured to use the certificates a secret  that makes the certificates accessible to pods you can acquire all these from the nginx https example .
this requires having go and make tools installed.
if you don't want to install those, then follow the manual steps later.
in short:

make keys key=/tmp/nginx.key cert=/tmp/nginx.crt
kubectl create secret tls nginxsecret --key /tmp/nginx.key --cert /tmp/nginx.crt

secret/nginxsecret created

kubectl get secrets

nginxsecret           kubernetes.io/tls                     2         1m

and also the configmap:

kubectl create configmap nginxconfigmap --from-file=default.conf

you can find an example for

default.conf

in the kubernetes examples project repo .

kubectl get configmaps

nginxconfigmap   1      114s

you can view the details of the nginxconfigmap configmap using the following command:

kubectl describe configmap  nginxconfigmap

the output is similar to:

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /d/tmp/nginx.key -out /d/tmp/nginx.crt -subj ""/cn=my-nginx/o=my-nginx""
# convert the keys to base64 encoding
cat /d/tmp/nginx.crt | base64
cat /d/tmp/nginx.key | base64

use the output from the previous commands to create a yaml file as follows.

for example, the pod might request more resources than are free on any node, or it might specify a label selector that doesn't match any nodes.
let's say we created the previous deployment with 5 replicas (instead of 2) and requesting 600 millicores instead of 500, on a four-node cluster where each (virtual) machine has 1 cpu.
in that case one of the pods will not be able to schedule.
(note that because of the cluster addon pods such as fluentd, skydns, etc., that run on each node, if we requested 1000 millicores then none of the pods would be able to schedule.)

kubectl get pods

nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd   0/1       pending   0          1m

to find out why the nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd pod is not running, we can use

kubectl describe pod

on the pending pod and look at its events:

kubectl describe pod nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd



name:		nginx-deployment-1370807587-fz9sd
  namespace:	default

  fit failure on node (kubernetes-node-wul5): node didn't have enough resource: cpu, requested: 1000, used: 1100, capacity: 2000

here you can see the event generated by the scheduler saying that the pod failed to schedule for reason failedscheduling (and possibly others).
the message tells us that there were not enough resources for the pod on any of the nodes.
to correct this situation, you can use kubectl scale to update your deployment to specify four or fewer replicas.
(or you could leave the one pod pending, which is harmless.) events such as the ones you saw at the end of

kubectl describe pod

are persisted in etcd and provide high-level information on what is happening in the cluster.
to list all events you can use

kubectl get events

but you have to remember that events are namespaced.
this means that if you're interested in events for some namespaced object (e.g.
what happened with pods in namespace my-namespace) you need to explicitly provide a namespace to the command:

kubectl get events --namespace=my-namespace

to see events from all namespaces, you can use the --all-namespaces argument.
in addition to

kubectl describe pod

, another way to get extra information about a pod (beyond what is provided by

kubectl get pod

) is to pass the -o yaml output format flag to

kubectl get pod

.
this will give you, in yaml format, even more information than

kubectl describe pod

--essentially all of the information the system has about the pod.
here you will see things like annotations (which are key-value metadata without the label restrictions, that is used internally by kubernete here is the configuration file for the application deployment: service/access/hello-application.yaml

            - containerport: 8080
              protocol: tcp

run a hello world application in your cluster: create the application deployment using the file above:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/service/access/hello-application.yaml

the preceding command creates a deployment  and an associated replicaset .
the replicaset has two pods  each of which runs the hello world application.
display information about the deployment:

kubectl get deployments hello-world
kubectl describe deployments hello-world

display information about your replicaset objects:

kubectl get replicasets
kubectl describe replicasets

create a service object that exposes the deployment:

kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=nodeport --name=example-service

display information about the service:

kubectl describe services example-service

the output is similar to this:

name:                   example-service
namespace:              default
labels:                 run=load-balancer-example

session affinity:       none
events:                 &lt;none&gt;

make a note of the nodeport value for the service.
for example, in the preceding output, the nodeport value is 31496.
list the pods that are running the hello world application:

kubectl get pods --selector=""run=load-balancer-example"" --output=wide

the output is similar to this:

name                           ready   status    ...  ip           node
hello-world-2895499144-bsbk5   1/1     running   ...  10.200.1.4   worker1
hello-world-2895499144-m1pwt   1/1     running   ...  10.200.2.5   worker2

get the public ip address of one of your nodes that is running a hello world pod.
how you get this address depends on how you set up your cluster.
for example, if you are using minikube, you can see the node address by running kubectl cluster-info.
if you are using google compute engine instances, you can use the

gcloud compute instances list

command to see the public addresses of your nodes.
on your chosen node, create a firewall rule that allows tcp traffic on your node port.
for example, if your service has a nodeport value of 31568, create a firewall rule that allows tcp traffic on port 31568.
different cloud providers offer different ways of configuring firewall rules.
use the node address and node port to access the hello world application: curl http://<public-node-ip>:<node-port> where <public-node-ip> is the public ip address of your node, and <node-port> is the nodeport value for your service.
the response to a successful request is a hello message:

hello, world!

### Explanation:
To resolve the WebSocket connection issues when using multiple replicas, ensure that the Nginx configuration is correctly set up to handle WebSocket connections. The `proxy_set_header` directives for `upgrade` and `connection` are already present in your Nginx configuration, which is good. 

However, ensure that the upstream servers (e.g., `api_app`, `web_app`, `admin_app`) are correctly defined and reachable. The error logs indicate that the connection to the upstream server is being refused, which may be due to incorrect upstream definitions or the application not being ready to accept connections.

Make sure that the service definitions and the deployment are correctly set up to route traffic to the appropriate pods. The above YAML maintains 3 replicas for scalability while ensuring that the configuration is correct.","```yaml

### Explanation:
To address the WebSocket connection issues when using multiple replicas, ensure that the Nginx configuration is properly set up to handle WebSocket connections. The `proxy_set_header` directives for `Upgrade` and `Connection` should be included in your Nginx configuration to facilitate WebSocket communication.

Additionally, verify that the upstream servers (e.g., `api_app`, `web_app`, `admin_app`) are correctly defined in your Nginx configuration and that they are reachable. The error logs indicating that the connection to the upstream server is being refused may suggest that the upstream definitions are incorrect or that the application is not ready to accept connections.

Ensure that your service definitions are correctly routing traffic to the appropriate pods. The provided YAML maintains 3 replicas for scalability while ensuring that the configuration aligns with best practices for handling WebSocket connections.","1882.0, 1350.0, 1627.0"

### Explanation
With Kustomize version 4.5.2, the patch you provided does not apply correctly and results in the following error: 
```
error: trouble configuring builtin patchTransformer with config: `
path: kubejobhistorylimit.yml
target:
  kind: CronJob
`: unable to parse sm or json patch from [apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
spec:
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
]
```
The issue arises because the `metadata.name` field is missing, which is a requirement even if it is ignored when patching multiple objects. By modifying the patch to include a placeholder name, as shown above, it resolves the issue. 

For example, if you have a base configuration file `base/cronjob1.yaml` that looks like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: cronjob1
spec:
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 2
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 5
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:

            - 60
            image: docker.io/alpine:latest
            name: example
  schedule: 30 3 * * *
```
And you use the above patch along with an overlay configuration in `overlay/kustomization.yaml` like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- ../base
patches:
- path: kubejobhistorylimit.yml
  target:
    kind: CronJob
```
When you run `kustomize build overlay`, the output will be:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: cronjob2
spec:
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - command:

            - 60
            image: docker.io/alpine:latest
            name: example

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:
  - .env
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;deployment.yaml
apiversion: apps/v1

          mountpath: /config
      volumes:
      - name: config
        configmap:
          name: example-configmap-1
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
resources:
- deployment.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

generate the configmap and deployment:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated deployment will refer to the generated configmap by name:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: e","here's the configuration file for a deployment that uses the rollingupdate strategy: application/deployment-retainkeys.yaml

create the deployment:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment-retainkeys.yaml

at this point, the deployment is created and is using the rollingupdate strategy.
create a file named

patch-file-no-retainkeys.yaml

that has this content:

spec:
  strategy:
    type: recreate

patch your deployment:

kubectl patch deployment retainkeys-demo --type strategic --patch-file patch-file-no-retainkeys.yaml

in the output, you can see that it is not possible to set type as recreate when a value is defined for

spec.strategy.rollingupdate

:

the deployment ""retainkeys-demo"" is invalid: spec.strategy.rollingupdate: forbidden: may not be specified when strategy `type` is 'recreate'

the way to remove the value for

spec.strategy.rollingupdate

when updating the value for type is to use the retainkeys strategy for the strategic merge.
create another file named

patch-file-retainkeys.yaml

that has this content:

spec:
  strategy:
    $retainkeys:
    - type
    type: recreate

with this patch, we indicate that we want to retain only the type key of the strategy object.
thus, the rollingupdate will be removed during the patch operation.
patch your deployment again with this new patch:

kubectl patch deployment retainkeys-demo --type strategic --patch-file patch-file-retainkeys.yaml

examine the content of the deployment:

kubectl get deployment retainkeys-demo --output yaml

the output shows that the strategy object in the deployment does not contain the rollingupdate key anymore:

  strategy:

notes on the strategic merge patch using the retainkeys strategy the patch you did in the preceding exercise is called a strategic merge patch with retainkeys strategy .
this method introduces a new directive $retainkeys that has the following strategies: it contains a list of strings.
all fields needing to be preserved must be present in the $retainkeys list.
the fields that are present will be merged with live object.
all of the missing fields will be cleared when patching.
all fields in the $retainkeys list must be a superset or the same as the fields present in the patch.
the retainkeys strategy does not work for all objects.
it only works when the value of the patchstrategy key in a field tag in the kubernetes source code contains retainkeys.
for example, the strategy field of the deploymentspec struct has a patchstrategy of retainkeys:

type deploymentspec struct {
  ...
  // +patchstrategy=retainkeys
  strategy deploymentstrategy `json:""strategy,omitempty"" patchstrategy:""retainkeys"" ...`
  ...
}

you can also see the retainkeys strategy in the openapi spec :

}

and you can see the retainkeys strategy in the kubernetes api documentation .
alternate forms of the kubectl patch command the kubectl patch command takes yaml or json.
it can take the patch as a file or directly on the command line.

kubeadm allows you to pass a directory with patch files to initconfiguration and joinconfiguration on individual nodes.
these patches can be used as the last customization step before component configuration is written to disk.
you can pass this file to kubeadm init with

--config &lt;your config yaml&gt;

:

apiversion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4

patches:
  directory: /home/user/somedir

the directory must contain files named

target[suffix][+patchtype].extension

.
for example,

kube-apiserver0+merge.yaml

or just

etcd.json

.
target can be one of kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, etcd and kubeletconfiguration.
suffix is an optional string that can be used to determine which patches are applied first alpha-numerically.
patchtype can be one of strategic, merge or json and these must match the patching formats supported by kubectl .
the default patchtype is strategic.
extension must be either json or yaml.
note: if you are using kubeadm upgrade to upgrade your kubeadm nodes you must again provide the same patches, so that the customization is preserved after upgrade.
to do that you can use the --patches flag, which must point to the same directory.
kubeadm upgrade currently does not support a configuration api structure that can be used for the same purpose.

### Explanation
Socket.io utilizes a specific path for its WebSocket communication, necessitating the configuration of the Kubernetes Ingress to support the ""/socket.io"" endpoint. Additionally, the Node.js middleware must be set up with a custom namespace for the socket endpoint. The provided Ingress configuration allows for WebSocket connections to be routed correctly, ensuring that both the `/websockettest` and `/socket.io` paths are handled by the `websockettest-cluster-ip-service` on port 3020. 

In the Node.js application, a namespace is created for the WebSocket connections, and event listeners are set up to handle incoming connections and messages. The React client connects to the WebSocket server using the specified namespace, enabling real-time communication.","official document: in some scenarios the exposed url in the backend service differs

more than one ingress is defined for a host and at least one ingress uses `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: cookie`, then only paths on the ingress using `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity`

[affinity](../../examples/affinity/cookie/readme.md) example. medium website: sometimes, you may find that your kubernetes application doesnt work properly when you first run more than 1 replica. in my experience, this is most frequently because the application is pod-stateful for example, the application may store session state in memory or is writing data required during subsequent requests to local-storage. an initial request is sent to pod a and the state is initialized and some subsequent request gets sent to pod b which doesnt have access to that state, and as a result the application doesnt behave as desired often, the initial reaction is ok, how can i make all requests for this session go to back to the pod that handled the initial request? kubernetes services support affinity by clientip. if you are accessing your application via an ingress, most ingress controllers will support a feature called session affinity example 1, example 2, example 3, usually using cookies. please dont think, however, that these options are silver bullets! its worth noting that one of the principles of container-based application design is process disposability. containers should be as ephemeral as possible and ready to be replaced by another container instance at any point in time. when for example your containers are storing session state in memory, they cant really be replaced by another container instance at least not without impacting some portion of your active users. there are some really good reasons for this principle. lets look at an example consider the following

### Explanation
Kubernetes primarily utilizes YAML syntax, which allows for multiple ""documents"" to be included within a single file, separated by the `---` delimiter. Helm, in turn, typically processes templates to generate a plain-text file, which is then passed to `kubectl apply`. 

As a result, if you begin each Kubernetes object definition with the `---` delimiter, it should function correctly.","say we've defined a simple template that looks like this:{{- define ""mychart.app"" -}} 
 app_name :   {{   .chart.name }} 
 app_version :   ""{{ .chart.version }}"" 
 {{- end -}}now say i want to insert this both into the  labels:  section of my template,
and also the  data:  section:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
    labels : 
      {{   template ""mychart.app"" . }} 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- range $key, $val := .values.favorite }} 
    {{   $key }} :   {{   $val | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
 {{   template ""mychart.app"" . }}if we render this, we will get an error like this:$  helm install --dry-run measly-whippet ./mychart
 error: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: error validating """": error validating data: [validationerror(configmap): unknown field ""app_name"" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.configmap, validationerror(configmap): unknown field ""app_version"" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.configmap]to see what rendered, re-run with  --disable-openapi-validation :
 helm install --dry-run --disable-openapi-validation measly-whippet ./mychart .
the output will not be what we expect:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml 
 apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   measly-whippet-configmap 
    labels : 
      app_name :   mychart 
 app_version :   ""0.1.0"" 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    drink :   ""coffee"" 
    food :   ""pizza"" 
 app_name :   mychart 
 app_version :   ""0.1.0""note that the indentation on  app_version  is wrong in both places. why? because
the template that is substituted in has the text aligned to the left. because
 template  is an action, and not a function, there is no way to pass the output
of a  template  call to other functions; the data is simply inserted inline.to work around this case, helm provides an alternative to  template  that will
import the contents of a template into the present pipeline where it can be
passed along to other functions in the pipeline.here's the example above, corrected to use  indent  to indent the  mychart.app 
template correctly:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
    labels : 
 {{   include ""mychart.app"" . | indent 4 }} 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- range $key, $val := .values.favorite }} 
    {{   $key }} :   {{   $val | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
 {{   include ""mychart.app"" . | indent 2 }}now the produced yaml is correctly indented for each section:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml 
 apiversion :   v1

    name :   edgy-mole-configmap

does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:apiversion :   v1

""range over"" (iterate through) the  pizzatoppings  list. but now something
interesting happens. just like  with  sets the scope of  . , so does a  range 
operator. each time through the loop,  .  is set to the current pizza topping.
that is, the first time,  .  is set to  mushrooms . the second iteration it is
set to  cheese , and so on.we can send the value of  .  directly down a pipeline, so when we do  {{ . | title | quote }} , it sends  .  to  title  (title case function) and then to
 quote . if we run this template, the output will be:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml

     - ""peppers""
     - ""onions""
     - ""pineapple""now, in this example we've done something tricky. the  toppings: |-  line is
declaring a multi-line string. so our list of toppings is actually not a yaml
list. it's a big string. why would we do this? because the data in configmaps
 data  is composed of key/value pairs, where both the key and the value are
simple strings. to understand why this is the case, take a look at the
 kubernetes configmap docs .
for us, though, this detail doesn't matter much.the  |-  marker in yaml takes a multi-line string. this can be a useful
technique for embedding big blocks of data inside of your manifests, as
exemplified here.sometimes it's useful to be able to quickly make a list inside of your template,
and then iterate over that list. helm templates have a function to make this
easy:  tuple . in computer science, a tuple is a list-like collection of fixed
size, but with arbitrary data types. this roughly conveys the way a  tuple  is
used.sizes :   |- 
     {{- range tuple ""small"" ""medium"" ""large"" }}
     - {{ . }}
     {{- end }}the above will produce this:sizes :   |- 
     - small
     - medium
     - largein addition to lists and tuples,  range  can be used to iterate over collections
that have a key and a value (like a  map  or  dict ). we'll see how to do that
in the next section when we introduce template variables.prev ← template function list next variables →","say we've defined a simple template that looks like this:{{- define ""mychart.app"" -}}

the template that is substituted in has the text aligned to the left. because
 template  is an action, and not a function, there is no way to pass the output
of a  template  call to other functions; the data is simply inserted inline.to work around this case, helm provides an alternative to  template  that will
import the contents of a template into the present pipeline where it can be
passed along to other functions in the pipeline.here's the example above, corrected to use  indent  to indent the  mychart.app

The fix involves ensuring that each deployment is correctly defined within the loop.

The provided configuration is structured to create a Deployment for each type defined in your Helm chart's `values.yaml`. The `apiVersion` is correctly set to `apps/v1`, which is the current standard for Deployments in Kubernetes. The `metadata.name` is dynamically generated to ensure each Deployment has a unique name based on the type. This configuration will create multiple Deployments, each corresponding to the types specified in your values file. 

If you need to define additional settings, such as resource limits or environment variables, please provide more context, as the current configuration focuses solely on the basic structure of the Deployment.","3602.0, 3445.0, 3598.0"

### Explanation
You can utilize the lookup function in Helm to verify the existence of a secret. For more details, refer to the Helm documentation on the lookup function: [Helm Lookup Function](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/functions_and_pipelines/#using-the-lookup-function). An example of how to implement this function in a Helm chart can be found here: [Helm Chart Example](https://github.com/sankalp-r/helm-charts-examples/blob/1081ab5a5af3a1c7924c826c5a2bed4c19889daf/sample_chart/templates/_helpers.tpl#l67). 

The secret creation process can be illustrated with the following example file: [Secret YAML Example](https://github.com/sankalp-r/helm-charts-examples/blob/main/sample_chart/templates/secret.yaml). The lookup function checks for the existence of the secret named ""test-secret"" in the specified namespace. If the secret exists, it retrieves the password; if not, it generates a new password.","often times configmaps or secrets are injected as configuration files in
containers or there are other external dependency changes that require rolling

declarative method above.","feature state:

kubernetes v1.21 [stable]

kubernetes lets you mark specific secrets (and configmaps) as immutable .
preventing changes to the data of an existing secret has the following benefits: protects you from accidental (or unwanted) updates that could cause applications outages (for clusters that extensively use secrets - at least tens of thousands of unique secret to pod mounts), switching to immutable secrets improves the performance of your cluster by significantly reducing load on kube-apiserver.
the kubelet does not need to maintain a [watch] on any secrets that are marked as immutable.
marking a secret as immutable you can create an immutable secret by setting the immutable field to true.
for example,

apiversion: v1
kind: secret
metadata: ...
data: ...
immutable: true

you can also update any existing mutable secret to make it immutable.
note: once a secret or configmap is marked as immutable, it is not possible to revert this change nor to mutate the contents of the data field.
you can only delete and recreate the secret.
existing pods maintain a mount point to the deleted secret - it is recommended to recreate these pods.
========================================","creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.
secret/optional-secret.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      optional: true

by default, secrets are required.
none of a pod's containers will start until all non-optional secrets are available.
if a pod references a specific key in a non-optional secret and that secret does exist, but is missing the named key, the pod fails during startup.
using secrets as files from a pod if you want to access data from a secret in a pod, one way to do that is to have kubernetes make the value of that secret be available as a file inside the filesystem of one or more of the pod's containers.

when a volume contains data from a secret, and that secret is updated, kubernetes tracks this and updates the data in the volume, using an eventually-consistent approach.

containers or there are other external dependency changes that require rolling
pods. depending on the application a restart may be required should those be
updated with a subsequent  helm upgrade , but if the deployment spec itself
didn't change the application keeps running with the old configuration resulting
in an inconsistent deployment.the  sha256sum  function can be used to ensure a deployment's annotation section
is updated if another file changes:kind :   deployment

          checksum/config :   {{   include (print $.template.basepath ""/configmap.yaml"") . | sha256sum }} 
 [...]note: if you're adding this to a library chart you won't be able to access your
file in  $.template.basepath . instead you can reference your definition with
 {{ include (""mylibchart.configmap"") . | sha256sum }} .in the event you always want to roll your deployment, you can use a similar
annotation step as above, instead replacing with a random string so it always
changes and causes the deployment to roll:kind :   deployment

 [...]each invocation of the template function will generate a unique random string.
this means that if it's necessary to sync the random strings used by multiple
resources, all relevant resources will need to be in the same template file.both of these methods allow your deployment to leverage the built in update
strategy logic to avoid taking downtime.note: in the past we recommended using the  --recreate-pods  flag as another
option. this flag has been marked as deprecated in helm 3 in favor of the more
declarative method above. feature state:

kubernetes v1.21 [stable]

kubernetes lets you mark specific secrets (and configmaps) as immutable .
preventing changes to the data of an existing secret has the following benefits: protects you from accidental (or unwanted) updates that could cause applications outages (for clusters that extensively use secrets - at least tens of thousands of unique secret to pod mounts), switching to immutable secrets improves the performance of your cluster by significantly reducing load on kube-apiserver.
the kubelet does not need to maintain a [watch] on any secrets that are marked as immutable.
marking a secret as immutable you can create an immutable secret by setting the immutable field to true.
for example,

apiversion: v1
kind: secret
metadata: ...
data: ...
immutable: true

you can also update any existing mutable secret to make it immutable.
note: once a secret or configmap is marked as immutable, it is not possible to revert this change nor to mutate the contents of the data field.
you can only delete and recreate the secret.
existing pods maintain a mount point to the deleted secret - it is recommended to recreate these pods.
======================================== creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.

      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      optional: true

by default, secrets are required.
none of a pod's containers will start until all non-optional secrets are available.
if a pod references a specific key in a non-optional secret and that secret does exist, but is missing the named key, the pod fails during startup.
using secrets as files from a pod if you want to access data from a secret in a pod, one way to do that is to have kubernetes make the value of that secret be available as a file inside the filesystem of one or more of the pod's containers.

```

To avoid recreating the Secret during a Helm upgrade, you can use the `lookup` function to check if the Secret already exists. If it does, you can use an existing password; if not, generate a new one. This ensures that the Pods using the Secret will not fail due to a missing or changed password.","```yaml

```

To prevent the recreation of the Secret during a Helm upgrade, you can utilize the `lookup` function to determine if the Secret already exists. If it does, you can reference the existing password; if it does not, generate a new one. This approach ensures that the Pods relying on the Secret will not encounter issues due to a missing or altered password.","3445.0, 485.0, 484.0"

### Explanation
Each container in Kubernetes has a default CPU request, which in GKE is typically set to 0.1 CPU (or 100m). If you have three containers in your pod, this results in a total CPU request of 0.3 CPU. The node you are deploying to has 0.68 CPU (680m) already requested by other workloads, with a total allocatable limit of 0.94 CPU (940m). 

To identify which workloads are consuming that 0.68 CPU, you can inspect the pods running on the node. In the GKE console, you can view resource allocations and limits per node, and by clicking on the node, you can access detailed information about the workloads. For instance, you might find that two kube-dns pods are each using 0.26 CPU, among other system pods necessary for cluster operation. The specific workloads you see will vary based on the add-on services you have enabled, such as HTTP load balancing (Ingress) or the Kubernetes dashboard.

Your pod's total CPU request would exceed the node's limit, reaching 0.98 CPU, which is why it cannot start. It's important to note that Kubernetes scheduling is based on the requested CPU for each workload, not the actual usage or limits.

You have a few options to resolve this issue:
1. Disable any unnecessary add-on services that are consuming CPU resources.
2. Increase the CPU resources available to your cluster by either upgrading your node pool to use VMs with more CPU or by adding more nodes to your existing pool. This can be done through the GKE console or the gcloud command line.
3. Explicitly set lower CPU requests for your containers to override the default values.","my pods are pending with event message failedscheduling if the scheduler cannot find any node where a pod can fit, the pod remains unscheduled until a place can be found.
an event  is produced each time the scheduler fails to find a place for the pod.
you can use kubectl to view the events for a pod; for example:

kubectl describe pod frontend | grep -a 9999999999 events



events:
  type     reason            age   from               message

  warning  failedscheduling  23s   default-scheduler  0/42 nodes available: insufficient cpu

in the preceding example, the pod named ""frontend"" fails to be scheduled due to insufficient cpu resource on any node.
similar error messages can also suggest failure due to insufficient memory (podexceedsfreememory).
in general, if a pod is pending with a message of this type, there are several things to try: add more nodes to the cluster.
terminate unneeded pods to make room for pending pods.
check that the pod is not larger than all the nodes.
for example, if all the nodes have a capacity of cpu: 1, then a pod with a request of

cpu: 1.1

will never be scheduled.
check for node taints.
if most of your nodes are tainted, and the new pod does not tolerate that taint, the scheduler only considers placements onto the remaining nodes that don't have that taint.
you can check node capacities and amounts allocated with the

kubectl describe nodes

command.
for example:

kubectl describe nodes e2e-test-node-pool-4lw4



name:            e2e-test-node-pool-4lw4

in the preceding output, you can see that if a pod requests more than 1.120 cpus or more than 6.23gi of memory, that pod will not fit on the node.
by looking at the “pods” section, you can see which pods are taking up space on the node.
the amount of resources available to pods is less than the node capacity because system daemons use a portion of the available resources.
within the kubernetes api, each node has a

.status.allocatable

field (see nodestatus  for details).
the

.status.allocatable

field describes the amount of resources that are available to pods on that node (for example: 15 virtual cpus and 7538 mib of memory).
for more information on node allocatable resources in kubernetes, see reserve compute resources for system daemons .
you can configure resource quotas  to limit the total amount of resources that a namespace can consume.
kubernetes enforces quotas for objects in particular namespace when there is a resourcequota in that namespace.
for example, if you assign specific namespaces to diffe","cpu requests and limits are associated with containers, but it is useful to think of a pod as having a cpu request and limit.
the cpu request for a pod is the sum of the cpu requests for all the containers in the pod.
likewise, the cpu limit for a pod is the sum of the cpu limits for all the containers in the pod.
pod scheduling is based on requests.
a pod is scheduled to run on a node only if the node has enough cpu resources available to satisfy the pod cpu request.
in this exercise, you create a pod that has a cpu request so big that it exceeds the capacity of any node in your cluster.
here is the configuration file for a pod that has one container.
the container requests 100 cpu, which is likely to exceed the capacity of any node in your cluster.

resources:

  requests:

because that container did not specify its own cpu request and limit, the control plane applied the default cpu request and limit  from the limitrange for this namespace.
at this point, your pod may or may not be running.
recall that a prerequisite for this task is that your nodes must have at least 1 cpu available for use.
if each of your nodes has only 1 cpu, then there might not be enough allocatable cpu on any node to accommodate a request of 800 millicpu.
if you happen to be using nodes with 2 cpu, then you probably have enough cpu to accommodate the 800 millicpu request.

in the preceding output, you can see that if a pod requests more than 1.120 cpus or more than 6.23gi of memory, that pod will not fit on the node.
by looking at the “pods” section, you can see which pods are taking up space on the node.
the amount of resources available to pods is less than the node capacity because system daemons use a portion of the available resources.
within the kubernetes api, each node has a

.status.allocatable

field (see nodestatus  for details).
the

.status.allocatable

field describes the amount of resources that are available to pods on that node (for example: 15 virtual cpus and 7538 mib of memory).
for more information on node allocatable resources in kubernetes, see reserve compute resources for system daemons .
you can configure resource quotas  to limit the total amount of resources that a namespace can consume.
kubernetes enforces quotas for objects in particular namespace when there is a resourcequota in that namespace.
for example, if you assign specific namespaces to diffe cpu requests and limits are associated with containers, but it is useful to think of a pod as having a cpu request and limit.
the cpu request for a pod is the sum of the cpu requests for all the containers in the pod.
likewise, the cpu limit for a pod is the sum of the cpu limits for all the containers in the pod.
pod scheduling is based on requests.
a pod is scheduled to run on a node only if the node has enough cpu resources available to satisfy the pod cpu request.
in this exercise, you create a pod that has a cpu request so big that it exceeds the capacity of any node in your cluster.
here is the configuration file for a pod that has one container.
the container requests 100 cpu, which is likely to exceed the capacity of any node in your cluster.

======================================== here's a manifest for a pod that has one container.
the container does not specify a cpu request, nor does it specify a cpu limit.

view detailed information about the pod:

kubectl get pod constraints-cpu-demo-4 --namespace=constraints-cpu-example --output=yaml

the output shows that the pod's single container has a cpu request of 800 millicpu and a cpu limit of 800 millicpu.
how did that container get those values?

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 800m
  requests:
    cpu: 800m

because that container did not specify its own cpu request and limit, the control plane applied the default cpu request and limit  from the limitrange for this namespace.
at this point, your pod may or may not be running.
recall that a prerequisite for this task is that your nodes must have at least 1 cpu available for use.
if each of your nodes has only 1 cpu, then there might not be enough allocatable cpu on any node to accommodate a request of 800 millicpu.
if you happen to be using nodes with 2 cpu, then you probably have enough cpu to accommodate the 800 millicpu request.
delete your pod:

kubectl delete pod constraints-cpu-demo-4 --namespace=constraints-cpu-example

**Explanation:** The pods are pending due to insufficient CPU resources. By specifying CPU requests for each container, you ensure that the scheduler can allocate resources appropriately. Adjusting the requests to a total that fits within the available CPU on your node will help resolve the scheduling issue.","```yaml

```

**Explanation:** The pods are pending due to insufficient CPU resources. Specifying CPU requests for each container allows the Kubernetes scheduler to allocate resources appropriately. Ensure that the total CPU requests do not exceed the available resources on your node to resolve the scheduling issue. If the issue persists, consider checking the node's resource availability or adjusting the requests accordingly.","503.0, 1148.0, 900.0"

### Explanation
The commands you mentioned do not exist. You can refer to this documentation for a complete list of available commands. According to that documentation, the purpose of a job is to create one or more pods and keep retrying their execution until the specified number of successfully terminated pods is reached. After that, the job tracks the successful completions. You cannot simply update the job, as certain fields are not updatable. To achieve your goal, you should delete the current job and create a new one.

I recommend maintaining all your configurations in files. If you encounter issues with configuring job commands, best practices suggest modifying these settings in YAML files and applying them to the cluster. This way, if your deployment fails, you have a backup of your configuration. If you're interested in improving this task, consider the two examples described below:

First, I've created several files:
1. **Job Definition (job.yaml)**:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: test1
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: test1
        image: busybox
        command: [""/bin/sh"", ""-c"", ""sleep 300""]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: foo
          mountPath: ""/script/foo""
      volumes:
      - name: foo
        configMap:
          name: my-conf
          defaultMode: 0755
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```
2. **Patch File (patch-file.yaml)**:
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: test1
        image: busybox
        command: [""/bin/sh"", ""-c"", ""echo 'patching test' && sleep 500""]
```
3. **ConfigMap (configmap.yaml)**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-conf
data:
  test: |
    #!/bin/sh
    echo ""script test""
```

If you want to automate this process, you can use a plugin.

A plugin is a standalone executable file that begins with `kubectl-`. To install a plugin, simply move its executable file to a location in your PATH. No installation or pre-loading is required. Plugin executables inherit the environment from the `kubectl` binary, and each plugin determines which command path it will implement based on its name.

Here is a file that can replace your job:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
kubectl patch -f job.yaml -p ""$(cat patch-file.yaml)"" --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl replace --force -f - && kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l job-name=test1 && kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l job-name=test1 --no-headers -o custom-columns="":metadata.name"") -- /bin/sh
```

This command uses an additional file (patch-file.yaml) where you can specify your changes for the job. After creating the file, change its permissions and move it:
```bash
sudo chmod +x ./kubectl-job
sudo mv ./kubectl-job /usr/local/bin
```

Now you can use it:
```bash
$ kubectl job
job.batch ""test1"" deleted
job.batch/test1 replaced
pod/test1-bdxtm condition met
pod/test1-nh2pv condition met
```

As you can see, the job has been replaced (deleted and created).

You can also use a single-line command, as shown in the example below:

```bash
kubectl get job test1 -o json | jq ""del(.spec.selector)"" | jq ""del(.spec.template.metadata.labels)"" | kubectl patch -f - --patch '{""spec"":  {""template"":  {""spec"":  {""containers"": [{""name"": ""test1"", ""image"": ""busybox"", ""command"": [""/bin/sh"", ""-c"",  ""sleep 200""]}]} }}}}' --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl replace --force -f -
```

With this command, you can manually change your job parameters. Here is the output:
```
job.batch ""test1"" deleted
job.batch/test1 replaced
```

As you can see, this solution works as well.","sometimes pod configuration options make it difficult to troubleshoot in certain situations.
for example, you can't run kubectl exec to troubleshoot your container if your container image does not include a shell or if your application crashes on startup.
in these situations you can use kubectl debug to create a copy of the pod with configuration values changed to aid debugging.
copying a pod while adding a new container adding a new container can be useful when your application is running but not behaving as you expect and you'd like to add additional troubleshooting utilities to the pod.
for example, maybe your application's container images are built on busybox but you need debugging utilities not included in busybox.
you can simulate this scenario using kubectl run:

kubectl run myapp --image=busybox:1.28 --restart=never -- sleep 1d

run this command to create a copy of myapp named myapp-debug that adds a new ubuntu container for debugging:

kubectl debug myapp -it --image=ubuntu --share-processes --copy-to=myapp-debug



defaulting debug container name to debugger-w7xmf.
if you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
root@myapp-debug:/#

note: kubectl debug automatically generates a container name if you don't choose one using the --container flag.
the -i flag causes kubectl debug to attach to the new container by default.
you can prevent this by specifying --attach=false.
if your session becomes disconnected you can reattach using kubectl attach.
the --share-processes allows the containers in this pod to see processes from the other containers in the pod.
for more information about how this works, see share process namespace between containers in a pod .
don't forget to clean up the debugging pod when you're finished with it:

kubectl delete pod myapp myapp-debug

copying a pod while changing its command sometimes it's useful to change the command for a container, for example to add a debugging flag or because the application is crashing.
to simulate a crashing application, use kubectl run to create a container that immediately exits:

kubectl run --image=busybox:1.28 myapp -- false

you can see using

kubectl describe pod myapp

that this container is crashing:

containers:
  myapp:
    image:         busybox
    ...
    args:
      false
    state:          waiting
      reason:       crashloopbackoff
    last state:     terminated
      reason:       error
      exit code:    1

you can use kubectl debug to create a copy of this pod with the command changed to an interactive shell:

kubectl debug myapp -it --copy-to=myapp-debug --container=myapp -- sh



if you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
/ #

now you have an interactive shell that you can use to perform tasks like checking filesystem paths or running the container command manually.
note: to change the command of a specific container you must specify its name using --container or kubectl debug will instead create a new container to run the command you specified.
the -i flag causes kubectl debug to attach to the container by default.
you can prevent this by specifying --attach=false.
if your session becomes disconnected you can reattach using kubectl attach.
don't forget to clean up the debugging pod when you're finished with it:

kubectl delete pod myapp myapp-debug

copying a pod while changing container images in some situations you may want to change a misbehaving pod from its normal production container images to an image containing a debugging build or additional utilities.
as an example, create a pod using kubectl run:

kubectl run myapp --image=busybox:1.28 --restart=never -- sleep 1d

now use kubectl debug to make a copy and change its container image to ubuntu:

kubectl debug myapp --copy-to=myapp-debug --set-image=*=ubuntu

the syntax of --set-image uses the same container_name=image syntax as

kubectl set image

.
*=ubuntu means change the image of all containers to ubuntu.
don't forget to clean up the debugging pod when you're finished wit","with the following example, you can learn how to use pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary pod restarts when a pod failure indicates a non-retriable software bug.

in the job status, the following conditions display: failuretarget condition: has a reason field set to podfailurepolicy and a message field with more information about the termination, like

container main for pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob-8ckj8 failed with exit code 42 matching failjob rule at index 0

.
the job controller adds this condition as soon as the job is considered a failure.
for details, see termination of job pods .
failed condition: same reason and message as the failuretarget condition.
the job controller adds this condition after all of the job's pods are terminated.
for comparison, if the pod failure policy was disabled it would take 6 retries of the pod, taking at least 2 minutes.
clean up delete the job you created:

the cluster automatically cleans up the pods.
========================================","with the following example, you can learn how to use pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary pod restarts based on custom pod conditions.
note: the example below works since version 1.27 as it relies on transitioning of deleted pods, in the pending phase, to a terminal phase (see: pod phase ).
first, create a job based on the config: /controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml 

apiversion: batch/v1
kind: job
metadata:
  name: job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue
spec:
  completions: 8
  parallelism: 2
  template:
    spec:
      restartpolicy: never
      containers:
      - name: main
        image: ""non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example""
  backofflimit: 6
  podfailurepolicy:
    rules:
    - action: failjob
      onpodconditions:
      - type: configissue

by running:

kubectl create -f job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml

note that, the image is misconfigured, as it does not exist.
inspect the status of the job's pods by running:

kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml

you will see output similar to this:

containerstatuses:
- image: non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example
   ...
   state:
   waiting:
      message: back-off pulling image ""non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example""
      reason: imagepullbackoff
      ...
phase: pending

note that the pod remains in the pending phase as it fails to pull the misconfigured image.
this, in principle, could be a transient issue and the image could get pulled.
however, in this case, the image does not exist so we indicate this fact by a custom condition.
add the custom condition.
first prepare the patch by running:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt; patch.yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - type: configissue
    status: ""true""
    reason: ""nonexistingimage""
    lasttransitiontime: ""$(date -u +""%y-%m-%dt%h:%m:%sz"")""
eof

second, select one of the pods created by the job by running:

podname=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

then, apply the patch on one of the pods by running the following command:

kubectl patch pod $podname --subresource=status --patch-file=patch.yaml

if applied successfully, you will get a notification like this: pod/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp patched delete the pod to transition it to failed phase, by running the command:

kubectl delete pods/$podname

inspect the status of the job by running:

kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml

in the job status, see a job failed condition with the field reason equal podfailurepolicy.
additionally, the message field contains a more detailed information about the job termination, such as:

pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp has condition configissue matching failjob rule at index 0

.
note: in a production environment, the steps 3 and 4 should be automated by a user-provided controller.
cleaning up delete the job you created:

kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue

the cluster automatically cleans up the pods.
========================================","sometimes pod configuration options make it difficult to troubleshoot in certain situations.
for example, you can't run kubectl exec to troubleshoot your container if your container image does not include a shell or if your application crashes on startup.
in these situations you can use kubectl debug to create a copy of the pod with configuration values changed to aid debugging.
copying a pod while adding a new container adding a new container can be useful when your application is running but not behaving as you expect and you'd like to add additional troubleshooting utilities to the pod.
for example, maybe your application's container images are built on busybox but you need debugging utilities not included in busybox.
you can simulate this scenario using kubectl run:

kubectl run myapp --image=busybox:1.28 --restart=never -- sleep 1d

run this command to create a copy of myapp named myapp-debug that adds a new ubuntu container for debugging:

kubectl debug myapp -it --image=ubuntu --share-processes --copy-to=myapp-debug



defaulting debug container name to debugger-w7xmf.
if you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
root@myapp-debug:/#

note: kubectl debug automatically generates a container name if you don't choose one using the --container flag.
the -i flag causes kubectl debug to attach to the new container by default.
you can prevent this by specifying --attach=false.
if your session becomes disconnected you can reattach using kubectl attach.
the --share-processes allows the containers in this pod to see processes from the other containers in the pod.
for more information about how this works, see share process namespace between containers in a pod .
don't forget to clean up the debugging pod when you're finished with it:

kubectl delete pod myapp myapp-debug

copying a pod while changing its command sometimes it's useful to change the command for a container, for example to add a debugging flag or because the application is crashing.
to simulate a crashing application, use kubectl run to create a container that immediately exits:

kubectl run --image=busybox:1.28 myapp -- false

you can see using

kubectl describe pod myapp

that this container is crashing:

containers:
  myapp:
    image:         busybox
    ...
    args:
      false
    state:          waiting
      reason:       crashloopbackoff
    last state:     terminated
      reason:       error
      exit code:    1

you can use kubectl debug to create a copy of this pod with the command changed to an interactive shell:

kubectl debug myapp -it --copy-to=myapp-debug --container=myapp -- sh



if you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
/ #

now you have an interactive shell that you can use to perform tasks like checking filesystem paths or running the container command manually.
note: to change the command of a specific container you must specify its name using --container or kubectl debug will instead create a new container to run the command you specified.
the -i flag causes kubectl debug to attach to the container by default.
you can prevent this by specifying --attach=false.
if your session becomes disconnected you can reattach using kubectl attach.
don't forget to clean up the debugging pod when you're finished with it:

kubectl delete pod myapp myapp-debug

copying a pod while changing container images in some situations you may want to change a misbehaving pod from its normal production container images to an image containing a debugging build or additional utilities.
as an example, create a pod using kubectl run:

kubectl run myapp --image=busybox:1.28 --restart=never -- sleep 1d

now use kubectl debug to make a copy and change its container image to ubuntu:

kubectl debug myapp --copy-to=myapp-debug --set-image=*=ubuntu

the syntax of --set-image uses the same container_name=image syntax as

kubectl set image

.
*=ubuntu means change the image of all containers to ubuntu.
don't forget to clean up the debugging pod when you're finished wit with the following example, you can learn how to use pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary pod restarts when a pod failure indicates a non-retriable software bug.
