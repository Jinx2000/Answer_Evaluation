2,"Since your application ""real"" root is /my/new/context, you can rewrite every incoming request matching the /dev/jira URI using Nginx's AppRoot:

If the Application Root is exposed in a different path and needs to be redirected, set the annotation nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root to redirect requests for /.

If you're using this approach, there is no need to use capture groups with rewrite-target.

      - path: /prod/jira(/|$)(.*)
        backend:
          serviceName: jira
          servicePort: 80","Based on the provided context and the issue of the context path of the Tomcat server, the NGINX Ingress annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root` should be used to redirect requests from the root path `/` to the context path of the application `/my/new/context`. The Ingress configuration should be adjusted to include this annotation so that all incoming requests are properly directed to the Tomcat server running at the specified context path.

Here is the corrected Ingress YAML configuration:

In this ingress definition, any characters captured by (.*) will be assigned to the placeholder $2, which is then used as a parameter in the rewrite-target annotation.

For example, the ingress definition above will result in the following rewrites: - rewrite.bar.com/something rewrites to rewrite.bar.com/ - rewrite.bar.com/something/ rewrites to rewrite.bar.com/ - rewrite.bar.com/something/new rewrites to rewrite.bar.com/new","**Answer:**

Based on the provided context, there is no direct way to achieve a redirection from an ingress hostpath to a subpath on the backend using standard Kubernetes Ingress resources. However, you can use NGINX annotations to rewrite the incoming requests to the desired subpath on the backend service.

Here is an example YAML configuration with annotations to achieve a rewrite for the described scenario:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: jupyter-notebook-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: jptrntbk.MYDOMAIN.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /lab(/|$)(.*)
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              service:
                name: jupyter-notebook-service

                  number: 8888
```",Y,
4,"As you mentioned, there is no error in the log files, and everything looks normal from your perspective. I may suggest to tune up ingress using annotations tags. I've checked documentation of ingress-nginx and found that below annotations may help a bit.

In some scenarios, the exposed URL in the backend service differs from the specified path in the Ingress rule. Without a rewrite, any request will return 404. Set the annotation

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target
to the path expected by the service.

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /

      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: http-svc
          servicePort: 80
        path: /something
If the Application Root is exposed in a different path and needs to be redirected, set the annotation

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root
to redirect requests for /.

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress

To address this issue and ensure proper redirection, you need to make changes to the Ingress definition annotations in such a way that requests to `/category/` get redirected correctly.

Below is a validated and comprehensive response to resolve the issue and optimize the Ingress resource configuration:

### Option 1: Use Custom `server-snippet` 

1. Create a Kubernetes Ingress resource with a custom `server-snippet` block to set the `Host` header before sending the request to the S3 bucket:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: s3-ingress

            name: s3-proxy
            port:
              number: 80
```

2. Ensure the `s3-proxy` Service points to the S3 endpoint:

kind: Service
metadata:
  name: s3-proxy
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com

For example:

Here is the validated YAML configuration for the Ingress resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: load-balancer
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /test(/|$)(.*)

  ingressClassName: nginx
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
```

Explanation:
- In the `paths` section of the Ingress resource, the `/test(/|$)(.*)` regex pattern captures any characters after `/test` (including an empty string) into the placeholder `$2`.
- The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2` annotation then rewrites the URI to exclude `/test` before forwarding the request to the backend service.

Potential issue:
- The provided context highlights the missing `pathType` in the Ingress configuration. Ensure that `pathType: ImplementationSpecific` is specified for the specific path to adhere to current best practices.

Debugging and troubleshooting steps:
1. Apply the above YAML configuration using `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`.
2. Send a test request to the endpoint `/abc` using `http://ip-address/abc` to verify that the rewrite rule is successful.
3. Monitor the NGINX Ingress Controller logs for any errors or warnings related to the rewrite functionality.
4. Use `kubectl describe ingress load-balancer` to check the applied annotations and paths to ensure they match the intended configuration.
5. If issues persist, review NGINX Ingress Controller logs and NGINX configuration to troubleshoot further.

10,"We have 2 issues here

1. Ingress route
2. SignalR with LoadBalancer
Ingress route
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
Rewrite has $1 it means to place first capturing group, but what is it? Well it's something that can be used only when nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex is added, so it just doesn't make sens, when request is send to get for file like /styles.css it would end up with something like /$1styles.css in Blazor app or anything else but not valid from your app point of view.

You can have for example

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: blazor-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: ""cookie""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: ""affinity""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-expires: ""14400""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-max-age: ""14400""
spec:
  rules:
    - host: blazor.test
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /

              service:
                name: blazor
                port:
                  number: 80
And everything should work, but rewrite /(path: /) to /(rewrite-target: / end with what we had at beginning, so removing line with rewrite-target has exactly same effect.

Another example using regex

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: blazor-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1

spec:
  rules:
    - host: blazor.test
      http:
        paths:

                port:
                  number: 80
In this case in path we have /(.*) and we have one capturing group what is (.*)(to make path / work correctly you must have * instead of +), then rewrite comes in and it says /$1 as we have regex enabled in place of $1 the value stored in first capturing group will be used here.","Based on the provided context and the issues faced with the Blazor Server app deployment on Kubernetes, I will provide corrected and enhanced YAML configurations with appropriate annotations:

Deployment YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:

spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: blazor
  template:

        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        imagePullSecrets:
        - name: test-webapp
```

Service YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: blazor
  name: blazor
  namespace: default
spec:

    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: blazor
  type: NodePort
```

Ingress YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: blazor-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /

            name: blazor
            port:
              number: 80
```

Explanation:
1. The Deployment YAML defines the pod template for the Blazor application with the necessary configurations.
2. The Service YAML exposes the Deployment internally and maps the container port to the service port, allowing inter-pod communication.
3. The Ingress YAML configures how external traffic is routed to the Blazor app using the specified annotations for session cookie management and rewriting target paths.

Potential Issues:
1. The provided Ingress YAML lacks the `pathType` field, which is essential for defining how paths should be matched. I have added `pathType: Prefix` assuming this is the desired behavior. Adjust it based on the specific routing needs.

Debugging Steps:
1. Verify the service and pods are running correctly.
2. Check network policies to ensure traffic flow.
3. Use `kubectl describe <resource>` commands to troubleshoot the resources.
4. Investigate Ingress controller logs for potential routing issues.
5. Ensure WebSocket protocols are correctly enabled in the Ingress controller configuration.

By implementing the corrected YAML configurations and following the suggested debugging steps, you should be able to address the issues faced with deploying the Blazor Server app on Kubernetes.

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: ""true""","To resolve the issue where the Minikube Ingress is not resolving, but the Minikube IP is working, we need to adjust the Ingress configuration to properly route traffic to the service. There are two main areas where adjustments need to be made: the Ingress resource definition and potential issues with the application deployment in the pod.

### 1. Deployment YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: api
  name: api
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
  template:

      - name: api
        image: localhost:5000/api:2.3
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 2. Service YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api
spec:
  selector:
    app: api
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
```

### 3. Ingress YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: tls-ingress
spec:
  tls:
    - secretName: oaky-tls
      hosts:
        - api.localhost
  rules:
    - host: api.localhost

              service:
                name: api

                  number: 80
```",N,
12,"According to my research I found the following way.

Remove the redirection from an ASP.NET Core app when we host it to kubernetes.
Apply the redirect to Ingress itself. By adding the following 2 lines to it:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: ""true""
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: ""true""

So my ingress code becomes:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: first-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: ""true""

Let me know your thoughts. If you have a better answer the kindly add a new answer on the question.","To enable HTTP to HTTPS redirection for your ASP.NET Core application running in a Kubernetes cluster, you need to configure the NGINX Ingress controller to perform the redirection. Since the redirection logic in your ASP.NET Core application (`app.UseHttpsRedirection()`) doesn't work when running behind the Ingress controller, you should handle the redirection at the Ingress controller level.

Here's how you can update your Ingress resource to handle HTTP to HTTPS redirection:

### Ingress Resource Configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: first-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: ""true""

13,"On ingress-nginx you can use the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""HTTPS""  annotation and point it to the HTTPS port on the service.

This is ingress controller specific and other ingress controllers might not provide the option (or provide an option that works differently)

With this setup, the ingress controller decrypts the traffic. (This allows the ingress controller to control things like ciphers and the certificate presented to the user and do path-based routing, which SSL passthrough does not allow)

It is possible to configure certificate validation with serveral other (ingress-nginx-specific) annotations: Docs

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-ssl-verify (it defaults to ""off"")
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-ssl-verify-depth
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-ssl-ciphers (ciphers, not validation related)
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-ssl-name (Override the name that the cert is checked against)
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-ssl-protocols (SSL / TLS versions)
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-ssl-server-name (SNI passthrough)","Based on the provided context and the information related to enabling HTTPS communication between the load balancer and the backend service in Kubernetes Ingress, below is the validated response along with the necessary configurations:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1

spec:
  tls:
  - secretName: testsecret
  backend:
    serviceName: s1
    servicePort: 80
```

Explanation:
1. `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""https""`: This annotation instructs NGINX Ingress to communicate with the backend service over HTTPS protocol. This aligns with the requirement of enabling HTTPS communication between the load balancer and the backend service.

Rationale:
- The annotation ensures that NGINX Ingress communicates with the backend service using HTTPS, enhancing security and confidentiality.
- By setting the backend protocol to HTTPS, the controller will establish secure communication with the backend service, ensuring encrypted data exchange.

Potential issue:
- Ensure that the NGINX Ingress Controller supports the `backend-protocol` annotation. This annotation should be valid and recognized by the Ingress controller being used.

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Apply the updated Ingress configuration with the `backend-protocol` annotation.
2. Check the NGINX Ingress Controller logs for any errors related to the HTTPS backend configuration.
3. Verify the communication between the load balancer and the backend service using tools like `curl` or `kubectl exec`.
4. Monitor the NGINX Ingress Controller's behavior to ensure that it is establishing HTTPS communication with the backend service.

By following the provided configuration and guidelines, you should be able to enable HTTPS communication between the load balancer and the backend service using Kubernetes Ingress with NGINX Ingress Controller.",Y,
14,"You should have to use the relative path in backend or HTML if you are using that.

The ingress controller supports case insensitive regular expressions in the spec.rules.http.paths.path field. This can be enabled by setting the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex annotation to true (the default is false).

The example they provide on the page would cover it:

To set up a Kubernetes Ingress rule with a regex path, you need to ensure that you use the correct annotations and configuration. Below is the validated solution with corrected annotations and explanations:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cafe-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
spec:
  rules:
  - host: cafe.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: ImplementationSpecific
        path: /t([a-z])a
        backend:
          service:
            name: tea-svc
            port:
              number: 80
      - pathType: ImplementationSpecific
        path: /coffee
        backend:
          service:
            name: coffee-svc
            port:
              number: 80
```

### Rationale and Explanations:
1. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""` annotation is required to enable the use of regular expressions in the path matching.
2. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1` annotation captures the matching group defined by the regex and rewrites the URI accordingly.
3. In the `paths` section, each path should have a `pathType` set to `ImplementationSpecific` to define that the path is using a custom implementation-specific logic.

### Potential Issues and Assumptions:
1. The provided YAML was missing the `pathType` field, which is crucial for ingress configurations with regex paths. Ensure that this field is correctly set based on the requirement.
2. The usage of regex paths in Ingress rules might sometimes lead to unexpected routing behavior. Validating the regex pattern is essential to ensure correct path matching.

### Debugging Steps:
1. Apply the updated Ingress YAML using `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml`.
2. Verify the Ingress using `kubectl get ingress cafe-ingress -o wide` to check if the Ingress rule is applied correctly.
3. Test access to the specified paths using a tool like `curl` to confirm that the regex path matching is working as expected.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up a Kubernetes Ingress rule with a regex path using the nginx ingress controller effectively.",Y,
17,"limit-rps is a local rate limit settings that is applied on a specific ingress object rather than in a config map provided to the ingress controller.

It will limit the number of requests per second from an IP adress:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: number of requests accepted from a given IP each second. The burst limit is set to this limit multiplied by the burst multiplier, the default multiplier is 5. When clients exceed this limit, limit-req-status-code default: 503 is returned.

Please se below for a dummy example. As you can see nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: 10 is added under metadata.annotations on the ingress object

It is possible to apply global rate limiting as well, please see the manual for details","```yaml

  namespace: default
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ""nginx""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: ""10"" # Set the limit to 10 requests per second
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-burst-multiplier: ""5""  # Default burst multiplier is 5
spec:
  rules:
    - http:

                port:
                  number: 80
```

Explanation:
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: ""10""`: Sets the rate limit to 10 requests per second.
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-burst-multiplier: ""5""`: Sets the burst multiplier to 5, which means the burst limit will be 10 * 5 = 50 requests.
- The `path` field under the `http` section defines the path for which the rate limiting will be applied.

Potential Issues or Critical Assumptions:
- The rate-limiting configuration in the Ingress resource is relying on NGINX Ingress Controller to apply those settings. Ensure that your NGINX Ingress Controller supports and is configured correctly to handle rate limiting.
- The user might need to verify that there are no conflicting annotations or configurations that could override the rate limiting settings.

Debugging and Troubleshooting:
1. Ensure that the NGINX Ingress Controller is running and healthy.
2. Check the NGINX Ingress Controller logs for any errors or warnings related to rate limiting configuration.
3. Test the rate limiting behavior by sending requests at a higher rate than the configured limit and verifying if requests are being limited as expected.
4. Consider using tools like `curl` with the appropriate headers to test the rate limiting behavior and analyze the response codes.
5. Check the NGINX Ingress Controller documentation for any specific troubleshooting steps related to rate limiting configurations.

By following these steps, the user should be able to effectively apply rate limiting using NGINX Ingress in their AKS environment.",Y,

19,"For the first question, you can use regex in your paths without any problem, you just need to annotate the ingress with the use-regex, at least according to the documentation (https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#use-regex)

Something like:

metadata:
  name: your-name
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
  spec:
    ...
or as an alternative, if you use the annotation for rewrite target, the regex should also be enforced.

As for the regex to use, in order to match the start of a path, for example all paths starting with something, like something_first or something_another, you could go for the simple:

something_[a-zA-Z0-9]*
For the second question I'm not sure of what you are asking, exactly. The Ingress is supposed to be used with http or https requests and those should provide a path. If you want to simply expose a service outside at a given port, you could go for a LoadBalancer service.

Internally, the service you want to access with just a port answers in http at the root path? Or does something different? If it answers only at the root path, you could match all paths in the request to the root path.

As for how you could make all paths of the request rewrite to root, you could go with a rewrite annotation, such as:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
For more info on this annotation, check the documentation because it can do a lot of things (https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/rewrite/)

Also take in mind that if you want to rewrite two services in two different places, you need to split the Ingress into two separate ingresses

Follow","To address your three issues with the Ingress configurations in YAML format based on the provided information, here are the annotations you can use:

1. Correctly implement regex to match the first part of a path in Ingress:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: search-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""

        backend:
          serviceName: global-search-service
          servicePort: 5050
```

2. Access a service with no path, just port using an iframe:
If you just need to access the service by port, without specifying a path, you can use the following configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: chart-ingress

        - path: /webservice($|/)(.*)
          backend:
            serviceName: service-wsstack --> backend
            servicePort: 80
This way you're asking nginx to rewrite your url with the second matching group. Finally it gives you:

/webservice => /
/webservice/data/office/getOffice => /data/office/getOffice","Based on the provided information and the issue you are facing, it seems that the path routing in the Ingress controller is not correctly redirecting the requests to the backend service. To fix this issue and properly route requests to the NodeJs backend service running on `/webservice`, you can use NGINX Ingress annotations for path rewriting.

Here is the updated Ingress configuration with the necessary annotations to properly route the requests:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: stack-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
spec:
  rules:
  - host: hello-world.info
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /webservice(/|$)(.*)
        backend:
          serviceName: service-wsstack
          servicePort: 80
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: service-ngstack
          servicePort: 80
```

In this configuration:
- The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation uses `$2` as a placeholder to capture the remaining part of the URI after `/webservice`.
- The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""` annotation enables regex matching for the path.
- The first path definition is for `/webservice`, which will route requests to the backend service `service-wsstack`.
- The second path definition is for `/`, which will route requests to the frontend service `service-ngstack`.

Applying this updated Ingress definition should redirect `/webservice` requests to the backend service as expected.

You can apply this configuration using the `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml` command. After applying the changes, test the endpoints again with `curl` to ensure the routing is working correctly.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask for help.",Y,

### Detailed Answer:

1. The ingress definition is missing the `pathType` field within the `paths` definition, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The `pathType` field should be set to `ImplementationSpecific` since the behavior implemented by NGINX ingress classifies it as such.

2. Since the original configuration does not use the rewrite annotation, the routing rules might not match the backend service paths properly.

3. To address the issue and correctly direct traffic to the respective services, the following annotations and adjustments should be made:

As an aside, there's a chance you might need to specify GRPCS instead of GRPC since it appears you are using SSL.

Another thing to call out is that the docs mention that this annotation replaces 'secure-backends' in older versions, which could be where you found the grpc-backend annotation you are currently using.","To fix the connection timed out issue for deploying a gRPC service in Azure Kubernetes Service using NGINX Ingress annotations, you can update the annotations in the Ingress resource YAML as follows:

30,"You can use following command to delete the POD forcefully.

<code>kubectl delete pod &lt;PODNAME&gt; --grace-period=0 --force --namespace
</code>","### Common Reasons for Pods Stuck in Terminating Status

1. **Node Issues**: If the node where the pods are running is experiencing issues (e.g., network connectivity problems, not enough resources, kubelet not responding), it might fail to delete the pods.

2. **Finalizers**: Pods might have finalizers that are preventing them from being deleted immediately. Finalizers are mechanisms in Kubernetes that allow you to perform cleanup tasks before the resource is fully deleted.

3. **Resource Quotas and Limits**: If there are resource constraints, the operations related to pod deletion might not be prioritized or could be delayed.

4. **Kubernetes Bugs or Version Issues**: Sometimes specific versions of Kubernetes might have bugs that cause unexpected behavior including issues with terminating pods.

### Steps to Troubleshoot and Resolve

#### Step 1: Check Node Health
Ensure that the nodes are healthy and are able to communicate with the Kubernetes control plane. You can check the status of the nodes using:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
If any node is in a `NotReady` state, investigate the kubelet logs on that node:
```bash
journalctl -u kubelet
```

#### Step 2: Inspect the Pod and Check for Finalizers
Check if the pods have any finalizers that might be blocking their deletion:
```bash
kubectl get pod pod-186o2 -o json | jq '.metadata.finalizers'
```
If there are finalizers that are no longer needed or are causing issues, you can remove them manually:
```bash
kubectl patch pod pod-186o2 -p '{""metadata"":{""finalizers"":null}}'
```

#### Step 3: Force Delete the Pods
If the pods are still stuck and you've ruled out issues with finalizers and node health, you can try to force delete the pods:
```bash
kubectl delete pod pod-186o2 --grace-period=0 --force
```
This command tells Kubernetes to delete the pod immediately without waiting for confirmation from the kubelet that the pod has been terminated.

#### Step 4: Check for Kubernetes and Kubelet Logs
If the issue persists, check the logs for the Kubernetes control plane and kubelet to look for any errors or warnings that might indicate what is preventing the pods from terminating:
```bash
# Check kubelet logs
journalctl -u kubelet

# Check Kubernetes control plane logs (if accessible, depends on setup)
journalctl -u kube-apiserver
journalctl -u kube-controller-manager
```",Y,
31,"As the handbook describes, you can reuse the Docker daemon from Minikube with eval $(minikube docker-env).
So to use an image without uploading it, you can follow these steps:

Set the environment variables with eval $(minikube docker-env)
Build the image with the Docker daemon of Minikube (e.g., docker build -t my-image .)
Set the image in the pod specification like the build tag (e.g., my-image)
Set the imagePullPolicy to Never, otherwise Kubernetes will try to download the image.

Important note: You have to run eval $(minikube docker-env) on each terminal you want to use, since it only sets the environment variables for the current shell session.","To use local Docker images directly with Minikube without needing to upload them to a registry, you can leverage Minikube's ability to reuse the Docker daemon. This approach simplifies the process as Minikube can directly use Docker images that are already built on your machine.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Start Minikube with the Docker Driver

Ensure Minikube is using the Docker driver, which allows you to use Docker images directly from your local Docker daemon.

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment to Use Minikube's Docker Daemon

Run this command to configure your shell to use the Docker daemon inside the Minikube instance. This means any Docker command you run in this shell session will interact with Minikube  s Docker daemon.

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

### Step 3: Build or Pull Your Docker Images

Now, any Docker operations you perform will use Minikube's Docker environment. If you haven't already built your Docker images, you can build them now, and they will be directly available to Minikube:

```bash
docker build -t fluxcapacitor/hdfs:latest .
```

Or if you already have the image on your local machine, it's already accessible to Minikube after the previous step.

### Step 4: Create Kubernetes Deployments Using Local Images

When creating deployments in Kubernetes, set the `imagePullPolicy` to `Never` to force Kubernetes to use the local image rather than pulling it from a registry.

Here  s how you can run your Docker container in Minikube:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hdfs-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hdfs
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hdfs
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hdfs
        image: fluxcapacitor/hdfs:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8989
        imagePullPolicy: Never
```

Save this file as `deployment.yaml` and apply it with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Step 5: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of your pods to ensure that the deployment was successful and the pod is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```",Y,
32,"There is no command to do exactly what you asked.
Here are some close matches.
Be careful before running any of these commands.  Make sure you are connected to the right cluster, if you use multiple clusters.  Consider running. kubectl config view first.
You can delete all the pods in a single namespace with this command:
kubectl delete --all pods --namespace=foo

You can also delete all deployments in namespace which will delete all pods attached with the deployments corresponding to the namespace
kubectl delete --all deployments --namespace=foo

You can delete all namespaces and every object in every namespace (but not un-namespaced objects, like nodes and some events) with this command:
kubectl delete --all namespaces

However, the latter command is probably not something you want to do, since it will delete things in the kube-system namespace, which will make your cluster not usable.
This command will delete all the namespaces except kube-system, which might be useful:
for each in $(kubectl get ns -o jsonpath=&quot;{.items[*].metadata.name}&quot; | grep -v kube-system);
do
  kubectl delete ns $each
done
","To delete all pods in all namespaces using Kubernetes, you can use the `kubectl` command-line tool. This tool interacts with the Kubernetes API to manage the state of your Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, and deleting resources like pods.

Here's how you can delete all pods in all namespaces:

### Using kubectl Command

You can use the following command to delete all pods in all namespaces:

```bash
kubectl delete pods --all --all-namespaces
```

#### Explanation:

- `kubectl delete pods`: This command tells `kubectl` to delete resources of type pod.
- `--all`: This flag specifies that you want to delete all pods.
- `--all-namespaces`: This flag specifies that the operation should be performed across all namespaces.

### Important Considerations

1. **Impact on Applications**: Deleting all pods can have a significant impact on your applications running in the cluster. All stateless applications will face downtime until the pods are recreated (if they are managed by controllers like Deployments, StatefulSets, etc.). For stateful applications, you might lose data if not properly backed up or if they are not using persistent storage.

2. **Controllers and Orphaned Resources**: If the pods are managed by higher-level controllers like Deployments, ReplicaSets, or StatefulSets, these controllers might immediately try to recreate the pods after they are deleted. To prevent this, you might need to scale down these controllers before deleting the pods or consider deleting the controllers themselves if appropriate.

3. **Namespace Resources**: Deleting pods does not delete other resources in the namespaces, such as services, persistent volume claims, or secrets. You might need to clean up these resources separately if needed.

### Alternative: Deleting Specific Pods or Using Labels

If you need more control over which pods to delete, you can use label selectors to delete only the pods that match certain labels:

```bash
kubectl delete pods -l app=myapp --all-namespaces
```

Here, `-l app=myapp` specifies that only pods with the label `app=myapp` should be deleted across all namespaces.",Y,"Upon looking at the docs, there is an API call to delete a single pod, but is there a way to delete all pods in all namespaces?"
33,"You can switch from local (minikube) to gcloud and back with:

kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME

to list all contexts:

<code>kubectl config get-contexts</code>

You can create different enviroments for local and gcloud and put it in separate yaml files. ","Yes, there is a straightforward way to switch between different Kubernetes environments (contexts) using `kubectl`, the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. This will allow you to manage both your local minikube cluster and your Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster from your MacBook without needing to manually transfer files or configurations.

### Step 1: Configure `kubectl` to Access Both Clusters

First, ensure that `kubectl` is configured to access both your local minikube cluster and your GKE cluster. You likely already have this setup for minikube, but you'll need to configure access to GKE as well.

For GKE, you can set up access using the following command:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --project [PROJECT_ID]
```

Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]`, `[ZONE]`, and `[PROJECT_ID]` with your cluster's name, the zone where your cluster is located, and your Google Cloud project ID, respectively.

This command configures `kubectl` to communicate with your GKE cluster by updating the `kubeconfig` file, typically located at `~/.kube/config`.

### Step 2: Verify Contexts

After setting up access, you can check the available contexts using:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

This command will list all configured contexts. You should see both your minikube and GKE contexts listed.

### Step 3: Switching Contexts

To switch between your local minikube and GKE clusters, use the following `kubectl` command:

```bash
kubectl config use-context [CONTEXT_NAME]
```

Replace `[CONTEXT_NAME]` with the name of the context you want to switch to. You can find the context names from the output of the `get-contexts` command.

For example, if your minikube context is named `minikube` and your GKE context is named `gke_[PROJECT_ID]_[ZONE]_[CLUSTER_NAME]`, you can switch to the minikube context like this:

```bash
kubectl config use-context minikube
```

And switch to the GKE context like this:

```bash
kubectl config use-context gke_[PROJECT_ID]_[ZONE]_[CLUSTER_NAME]
```

### Step 4: Deploying YAML Files

Once you've switched to the desired context, you can apply your YAML files directly to the chosen cluster using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f [FILE_NAME]
```

Replace `[FILE_NAME]` with the path to your YAML file.",Y,"I have Kubernetes operating well in two different environments, namely in my local environment (MacBook running minikube) and as well as on Google's Container Engine (GCE, Kubernetes on Google Cloud). I use the MacBook/local environment to develop and test my YAML files and then, upon completion, try them on GCE.
Currently I need to work with each environment separately: I need to edit the YAML files in my local environment and, when ready, (git) clone them to a GCE environment and then use/deploy them.  This is a somewhat cumbersome process.
Ideally, I would like to use kubectl from my Macbook to easily change between the local minikube or GCE Kubernetes environments and to easily determine where the YAML files are used. Is there a simple way to switch contexts to do this?"
34,"You need to delete the deployment, which should in turn delete the pods and the replica sets https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/24137
To list all deployments:
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces

Then to delete the deployment:
kubectl delete -n NAMESPACE deployment DEPLOYMENT

Where NAMESPACE is the namespace it's in, and DEPLOYMENT is the name of the deployment. If NAMESPACE is default, leave off the -n option altogether.
In some cases it could also be running due to a job or daemonset.
Check the following and run their appropriate delete command.
kubectl get jobs

kubectl get daemonsets.app --all-namespaces

kubectl get daemonsets.extensions --all-namespaces
","It appears that the issue you're encountering with the `busybox` pod continuously being recreated despite deletion attempts might be due to a higher-level controller that is managing the pod. In Kubernetes, such behavior is typically controlled by ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, or Deployments. Since you used the `kubectl run` command, it's possible that a Deployment or ReplicaSet was created automatically to manage the pod.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Identify the Controller
First, let's identify if there is a Deployment or ReplicaSet that is managing the pod. You can do this by checking for any Deployments or ReplicaSets in your namespace.

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get replicasets
```

### Step 2: Delete the Deployment or ReplicaSet
If you find a Deployment or ReplicaSet that seems to be managing your `busybox` pod, you should delete it. Deleting the Deployment or ReplicaSet will stop it from recreating the pod.

If it's a Deployment, delete it using:
```bash
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>
```

If it's a ReplicaSet, delete it using:
```bash
kubectl delete replicaset <replicaset-name>
```

Replace `<deployment-name>` or `<replicaset-name>` with the actual name of the Deployment or ReplicaSet managing your pod.

### Step 3: Delete Any Remaining Pods
After deleting the controlling object, you can then delete any remaining pods that were managed by it.

```bash
kubectl delete pod --selector=run=busybox --grace-period=0 --force
```

This command deletes all pods with the label `run=busybox`, which is typically set by the `kubectl run` command.

### Explanation
The reason why the pod keeps being recreated is likely due to a ReplicaSet or Deployment automatically created by the `kubectl run` command. In Kubernetes, these controllers are designed to maintain a set number of replicas of a pod, and they will recreate pods to maintain the desired state if pods are deleted or terminated unexpectedly.

By deleting the controller (Deployment or ReplicaSet), you remove the mechanism that Kubernetes uses to ensure the desired number of pods is running. Once the controller is deleted, you can then manually delete the pods without them being recreated.

### Additional Note
In newer versions of Kubernetes, the `--generator` flag used in your `kubectl run` command is deprecated. The `kubectl run` command now creates a pod directly without a Deployment unless specifically instructed to do otherwise. If you intend to create a Deployment using `kubectl run`, you should explicitly specify the kind of resource to create. For example:
```bash
kubectl create deployment busybox --image=busybox
```
This command creates a Deployment rather than a standalone pod.",Y,"I have started pods with command
<code>
$ kubectl run busybox \
--image=busybox \

35,"Those are two different approaches:
Imperative Management
kubectl create is what we call Imperative Management. On this approach you tell the Kubernetes API what you want to create, replace or delete, not how you want your K8s cluster world to look like.
Declarative Management
kubectl apply is part of the Declarative Management approach, where changes that you may have applied to a live object (i.e. through scale) are &quot;maintained&quot; even if you apply other changes to the object.

You can read more about imperative and declarative management in the Kubernetes Object Management documentation.

They do different things. If the resource exists, kubectl create will error out and kubectl apply will not error out.","The three operations you're referring to`kubectl create`, `kubectl replace`, and `kubectl apply`are indeed similar in that they all interact with resources in a Kubernetes cluster, but they serve different purposes and operate in distinct ways. Let's break down each command and discuss their use cases and how they differ under the hood.
?
### 1. `kubectl create`
**Purpose:** This command is used to create a new resource in a Kubernetes cluster. It takes a file or stdin that contains the configuration of the resource and creates it based on this specification.
?
**Use Case:** Use `kubectl create` when you need to create new resources in your cluster and you are sure that these resources do not exist. It's straightforward and explicit, making it ideal for initial setups and scripts where you want to ensure that resources are created from scratch.
?
**Under the Hood:** When you run `kubectl create`, Kubernetes takes the YAML or JSON definition, validates it, and then sends it to the API server which creates the resource. If the resource already exists, the command will fail.
?
**Example:**
```bash
kubectl create -f my-resource.yaml
```
?
### 2. `kubectl replace`
**Purpose:** This command replaces a resource in your cluster with a new version you specify. It requires that the resource already exists.
?
**Use Case:** Use `kubectl replace` when you need to forcefully replace an existing resource with a new one. This is useful for cases where you want to overwrite all the existing specifications of a resource with a new set of specifications.
?
**Under the Hood:** `kubectl replace` first deletes the existing resource and then creates a new one with the specified configuration. This means all the existing settings are removed and replaced, which can lead to service disruption if not managed carefully.
?
**Example:**
```bash
kubectl replace -f updated-resource.yaml
```
?
### 3. `kubectl apply`
**Purpose:** This command is used to apply a configuration to a resource in a cluster. It creates the resource if it does not exist, or updates it if it does, while attempting to preserve runtime changes.
?
**Use Case:** Use `kubectl apply` for managing applications through files defining declarative configurations. It is ideal for version-controlled configuration that needs to be pushed to a cluster, as it merges changes incrementally.
?
**Under the Hood:** `kubectl apply` uses a three-way merge strategy. It compares the current configuration (`live`), the input configuration (`new`), and the last-applied configuration, then merges the changes. This approach helps in preserving manual changes made to the live configuration, which are not overwritten by the configuration file.
?
**Example:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f resource.yaml
```
?
### Summary
- **`kubectl create`** is for creating new resources.
- **`kubectl replace`** is for replacing existing resources entirely.
- **`kubectl apply`** is for updating existing resources while preserving runtime changes.
?
Each command is tailored for different scenarios in the lifecycle and management of Kubernetes resources, providing flexibility and control over how changes are applied to the cluster.",Y,"What I understood by the documentation is that:

kubectl create, Creates a new k8s resource in the cluster

kubectl replace, Updates a resource in the live cluster

36,"The issue #47538 that @jdf mentioned is now closed and this is now possible. The original implementation can be found here but the syntax has changed.
With kubectl v1.10.1+ the command is:
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<cronjob-name> <job-name> -n namespace-name
It seems to be backwardly compatible with older clusters as it worked for me on v0.8.x.","To manually trigger a Kubernetes Scheduled Job (also known as a CronJob), you can create a Job from the CronJob's template. This allows you to run the job immediately, outside of its scheduled times. Here's how you can do it:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Manually Trigger a Kubernetes CronJob

1. **Get the CronJob YAML**: First, you need to get the YAML definition of the CronJob you want to trigger. You can do this by using the `kubectl` command. Replace `<cronjob-name>` with the name of your CronJob and `<namespace>` with the namespace it resides in (if it's not in the default namespace).

   ```bash
   kubectl get cronjob <cronjob-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
   ```

2. **Create a Job YAML from CronJob**: Extract the `jobTemplate` section from the CronJob YAML. This section contains the template that Kubernetes uses to create new Jobs according to the schedule. You'll need to make a slight modification to use it as a standalone Job.

   Here's an example of what the Job YAML might look like, extracted and modified from the CronJob's `jobTemplate`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: Job
   metadata:
     name: <job-name>  # You can specify a unique name for the job
     namespace: <namespace>
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: <container-name>
           image: <image>
           # Add other container specs here
         restartPolicy: Never
   ```

   Make sure to replace `<job-name>`, `<namespace>`, `<container-name>`, and `<image>` with appropriate values.

3. **Create the Job**: Once you have your Job YAML ready, you can create the Job in Kubernetes by applying the YAML file:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f job.yaml
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer not to create a YAML file, you can use `kubectl create` directly from the command line:

   ```bash
   kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<cronjob-name> <job-name> -n <namespace>
   ```

   This command creates a new Job based on the template of the specified CronJob.

### Reasons for This Approach

- **Testing and Debugging**: Manually triggering a Job allows you to test and debug the job execution without waiting for the scheduled time. This is particularly useful during development and troubleshooting.
- **Control and Flexibility**: You have control over when the job runs, which is useful for operations that need to be performed immediately or on an ad-hoc basis.
- **Isolation**: Running a Job manually from the CronJob template ensures that the execution environment is the same as it would be during scheduled runs, maintaining consistency.

By following these steps, you can manually trigger a Kubernetes CronJob whenever needed, providing flexibility in managing scheduled tasks.",Y,"I've created a Kubernetes Scheduled Job, which runs twice a day according to its schedule. However, I would like to trigger it manually for testing purposes. How can I do this?"
37,"the ~/.kube/config wasn't updated with the changes.
i ran:
mkdir -p $home/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $home/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $home/.kube/config  

and it fixed it.","The error message ""you must be logged in to the server (unauthorized)"" typically indicates an issue with the authentication credentials in your kubeconfig file, especially after renewing certificates. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis and Fix:

1. **Localization**: The issue is likely related to the kubeconfig file, specifically the client certificate and key used for authentication.

2. **Reasoning**: After renewing the certificates, the kubeconfig file may still reference the old client certificate or key, which has expired. This can lead to the unauthorized error when trying to access the Kubernetes API.

3. **Remediation**: You need to ensure that the kubeconfig file is updated with the new client certificate and key. Here’s how to do that:

   - First, check the current kubeconfig file:
     ```bash
     cat $HOME/.kube/config
     ```

   - If the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` fields are still pointing to the old certificates, you need to update them. You can regenerate the kubeconfig file using the renewed certificates.

   - To overwrite the existing kubeconfig for the ""admin"" user, run the following commands:
     ```bash
     mv $HOME/.kube $HOME/.kube.bak
     mkdir $HOME/.kube
     sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
     sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
     ```

4. **Verification**: After updating the kubeconfig file, verify that you can now access the Kubernetes API:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

### Summary:
The unauthorized error is likely due to the kubeconfig file still referencing expired certificates. By regenerating the kubeconfig file with the updated certificates, you should be able to resolve the issue. 

If you continue to face issues, ensure that the `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` in the kubeconfig file are correctly set to the new certificates.",Y,"my certificates were expired:

38,"users and clusters are tied to a context and you can change users and clusters by changing the context.

kubectl config use-context my-context-name


above command sets the current context to my-context-name.now when kubectl is used the user and cluster tied to my-context-name context will be used.

check the docs for more details and various other available options.","""To switch to your company's account in `kubectl`, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl config use-context <your-company-context>
```

### Steps to Identify the Context:
1. **List Available Contexts**: First, check the available contexts in your kubeconfig file by running:
   ```bash
   kubectl config get-contexts
   ```
   This will display a list of contexts, including your company's context and your personal context.

2. **Switch Context**: Once you identify the correct context for your company's account, use the `kubectl config use-context` command as shown above, replacing `<your-company-context>` with the actual name of your company's context.

### Verification:
After switching contexts, you can verify that you are using the correct context by running:
```bash
kubectl config current-context
```
This should return the context name for your company's account.

### Common Mistakes:
- Ensure that the context name is spelled correctly.
- If you encounter permission issues, verify that your company's credentials are correctly configured in the kubeconfig file.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully switch to your company's account in `kubectl`.""",Y,"in my machine i have two kubectl users, my company's account and my personal account. i can confirm that by running kubectl config view.

shinyapp(ui, server)

here is a related article.
","**Issue Summary:** The user is experiencing issues with a Shiny application deployed on Kubernetes, specifically when using `dt::renderDataTable(..., server = FALSE)`. The application works correctly with a single replica but fails to update the data correctly when scaled to multiple replicas. The user suspects that session stickiness is not maintained, leading to data inconsistency.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Session Stickiness:** When using multiple replicas, if session stickiness is not configured, requests from the same user may be routed to different replicas, causing inconsistencies in the data displayed.
2. **Client-Side Processing:** With `server = FALSE`, the data is processed on the client side, which can lead to issues when the underlying data changes, as the client does not automatically refresh the data from the server.
3. **Data Proxying:** The use of `datatableProxy` and `replaceData` may not work as expected when the data is not synchronized across replicas.

**Step-by-Step Fix:**
1. **Enable Session Stickiness:** Modify the Kubernetes service to ensure that sessions are sticky. This can be done by adding annotations to the service for the load balancer to maintain session affinity.

Here’s the updated YAML configuration for the service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-appname
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-connection-idle-timeout: ""3600"" # Example for AWS
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type: ""nlb"" # Example for AWS NLB
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 3838
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 3838
  selector:
    app: appname
  type: LoadBalancer
  sessionAffinity: ClientIP # Enable session stickiness
```

**Verification:**
- Ensure that the YAML is syntactically correct and follows Kubernetes best practices.
- The `sessionAffinity: ClientIP` setting will help maintain session stickiness, ensuring that requests from the same user are routed to the same pod.

**References:**
- [Kubernetes Service Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
- [Session Affinity in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#session-affinity)

**Common Mistakes & Best Practices:**
- Always verify that your load balancer supports session stickiness and configure it accordingly.
- Test the application with multiple users to ensure that the data updates correctly across replicas.
- Monitor the application logs for any errors related to data fetching or session management.",N,"for various reasons i want to be able to use a proxied data table and replacedata while client side processing is being used i.e. dt::renderdatatable(..., server = false).
context
i have a shiny application/dashboard that communicates to a database and presents information to a user. the user is able to fill out a form in the application which will be added to the database and then the shiny app updates the data by making a query to the database to fetch the new information.
the application is currently being deployed via kubernetes using a loadbalancer with the intention to use multiple replicas to scale up the application as needed. the application is not being run through shinyproxy.
caveats
currently, when the application is being run by a single replica (process) the application will behave perfectly fine and is able to use server=true. however when i increase the number of processes/replicas to run, the data is not able to be presented to users unless server=false is specified in renderdatatable. for a currently unknown reason but i suspect it might be due to the sessions not being sticky to ips
while the code is able to function fine when server = true if i want to allow multiple users to application they all cannot share a single process as the application will become very slow once multiple connections are made. as a result i likely need to use server=false so each user is able to see the data at the cost of a very important functional detail (replacedata stops working). the product owner of the application is insistent that this behaviour remains intact as the data present is often large and requires some column sorting and paging to find a piece of information you want to look at. and when submitting a form, if i do not use replacedata and reconstruct the table from scratch the users previous table state is lost.
so while i could tear down the datatable and regenerate it within an observeevent
observeevent(input$button, {
    ...
    output$table = renderdatatable({dt::datatable(df(), selection = 'single', callback = 
    js(&quot;$.fn.datatable.ext.errmode = 'none';&quot;))}, server = false)
    ...
})

this would provide a solution that would yield unfavourable behaviour even though it will update the table accordingly.
repoducible example
this will create an application with a button and a table. select a row on the table and then click the button. the expected behaviour would be that the table updates with 'new_content' on the row that is selected. this will only work when server=true, nothing will happen when server=false.
library(shiny)
library(dt)
data(iris)

server &lt;- function(input, output, session) {
  iris$new_col = ''
  df = reactive({iris})
  output$table = renderdatatable({
      dt::datatable(df(), selection = 'single', 
        callback = js(&quot;$.fn.datatable.ext.errmode = 'none';&quot;))}, server = false) # when true code works fine,,,
  proxy = datatableproxy('table')

  observeevent(input$button, {
    # this line would be replacing the write to a db
    iris[input$table_rows_selected, 'new_col'] &lt;- 'changed'
    # this line would be replacing the query to the db to reflect changes the user (and potentially other users have made between loading the data previously.
    df &lt;- reactive({iris})
    proxy %&gt;% replacedata(df(), rownames = true, resetpaging = false)
  })
}
    
ui &lt;- fluidpage(
  actionbutton('button', 'press me'),
  dt::dtoutput('table') 
)

shinyapp(ui, server)

i have done a fairly extensive search on so and this was the closest question i could find: dt editing in shiny application with client-side processing (server = f) throws json error however this isn't actually answered and provides an answer of &quot;it just does not work&quot;.
kubernetes.yaml (only look if you are a wizard)
i am including the yaml file incase there are some kubernetes boffins that know how to specifically solve the above issue with some clever trickery. the described problem might stem from sessions being swapped between replicas thus the data gets miscommunicated but i am honestly not the best at kubernetes... if that is the case and i would then be able to use server=true within the shiny application then this would also solve the problem.

40,"i was running helm version 2.8.2 when obtaining this error, upgrading to v2.9.1 fixed this!
","**Issue Summary:**
The user is encountering an error when trying to run `helm init` on an AWS EKS cluster, specifically related to permissions and creating deployments in the `kube-system` namespace.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. The error message indicates that the user ""system:anonymous"" does not have the necessary permissions to create deployments in the `kube-system` namespace.
2. This issue is likely related to the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) configuration in the Kubernetes cluster, where the service account `tiller` does not have the required permissions.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Check the RBAC configuration for the `tiller` service account in the `kube-system` namespace.
2. Ensure that the service account has the appropriate roles and role bindings to create deployments.
3. Grant the necessary permissions to the `tiller` service account to create deployments in the `kube-system` namespace.

Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:
1. Check the RBAC configuration for the `tiller` service account in the `kube-system` namespace:
   ```
   kubectl get serviceaccount tiller -n kube-system -o yaml
   ```
2. Verify the roles and role bindings associated with the `tiller` service account:
   ```
   kubectl get rolebindings,roles --all-namespaces | grep tiller
   ```
3. If the `tiller` service account does not have the necessary permissions, create a ClusterRoleBinding to grant the required permissions:
   ```
   kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller
   ```
4. Re-run the `helm init` command with the `--service-account tiller --upgrade` flags:
   ```
   helm init --service-account tiller --upgrade
   ```

**Verification:**
After following the steps above, re-run the `helm init` command. If the RBAC configuration and permissions are correctly set up, the command should run without any errors.

**References:**
- Kubernetes RBAC: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/
- Helm RBAC Configuration: https://helm.sh/docs/rbac/

**Common Mistakes & Best Practices:**
- Ensure that the service account used by Helm (`tiller` in this case) has the necessary permissions to perform the required actions.
- Avoid hardcoding tokens and instead rely on proper RBAC configurations for security and best practices.",N,"having my cluster up and running on aws eks, i'm finding trouble running helm init with the following error:

$ helm init --service-account tiller --upgrade

kubectl works properly (object retrieval, creation and cluster administration), authenticating and authorizing correctly by running heptio-authenticator-aws at connection time ( with an exec section in the kubectl config).

in order to prepare the cluster for helm, i created the service account and role binding as specified in the helm docs.

i've heard of people having helm running on eks, and i'm guessing they're skipping the exec section of the kubectl config by hardcoding the token... i'd like to avoid that!

any ideas on how to fix this? my guess is that it is related to helm not being able to execute heptio-authenticator-aws properly"
41,"this is a community wiki answer. feel free to expand it.
unfortunately, as you already found out, this addon is not supported with with vm-driver=none.
if you use the none driver, some kubernetes components run as privileged containers that have side effects outside of the minikube environment. those side effects mean that the none driver is not recommended for personal workstations.
also, according to the official docs:

most users of this driver should consider the newer docker
driver, as it is significantly easier to configure and does not
require root access. the ‘none’ driver is recommended for advanced
users only.

so basically you have two options here:

downgrade to minikube v1.11 (not recommended)

use a supported driver (strongly recommended)


remember that these changes are made for a reason and going against them is usually a bad idea. it would be better to follow the official recommendation.
","**Issue Summary:**
The user is facing an issue with enabling the Ingress addon on Minikube with the ""driver=none"" option due to networking limitations, as indicated by the error message received.

**Root Cause Analysis (CoT Reasoning):**
1. The ""driver=none"" option in Minikube uses the host network for the Kubernetes cluster, which can lead to networking limitations.
2. Ingress relies on networking components like LoadBalancer services or NodePorts, which may not function properly in the ""driver=none"" mode.
3. The error message specifically mentions that Ingress addon is not supported due to networking limitations of the ""none"" driver.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Since the ""driver=none"" option in Minikube restricts the use of Ingress due to networking limitations, an alternative approach is needed.
2. One possible solution is to use a different driver that supports Ingress, such as VirtualBox or KVM.
3. To switch the Minikube driver, you can run the following command:
   ```
   minikube config set driver <driver_name>
   minikube delete
   minikube start
   ```
4. After switching to a supported driver, you should be able to enable the Ingress addon without encountering the networking limitations.

**Verification:**
After switching to a different driver that supports Ingress, try enabling the Ingress addon again using the command:
```
minikube addons enable ingress
```
If the Ingress addon is successfully enabled without any errors, the issue is resolved.

**References:**
- Minikube Documentation: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/
- Kubernetes Ingress Documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/

**Common Mistakes & Best Practices:**
- Avoid using the ""driver=none"" option in Minikube if you require features like Ingress that rely on networking components.
- Always check the compatibility of Minikube drivers with the desired Kubernetes features before setting up the cluster.",Y,"i am using minikube on my laptop with &quot;driver=none&quot; option. when i try to enable ingress, i got the following error:

","Based on the error messages you provided, it seems like there are issues with the configuration of the Kubernetes executor in your Airflow setup. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the problem:

1. **JSON Format Issue**: The error message `expecting property name enclosed in double quotes` suggests that there might be an issue with the format of the `kube_client_request_args` configuration. Make sure that the JSON format is correct and all property names are enclosed in double quotes. 

2. **Environment Variable Configuration**: Since setting the configuration directly in the `values.yaml` file didn't work, you can try setting the `kube_client_request_args` as an environment variable in your Dockerfile. Ensure that the format is correct and the environment variable is properly passed to the Airflow scheduler pod.

3. **SSL Error**: The `wantreaderror` related to SSL in the scheduler pod could be due to network connectivity issues or SSL configuration problems. Check if there are any network restrictions or firewall rules blocking the communication between the Airflow scheduler pod and the Kubernetes API server.

4. **Debugging**: Enable verbose logging in the Airflow scheduler pod to get more detailed information about the errors. This can help in pinpointing the exact cause of the issues.

5. **Update Dependencies**: Make sure that all dependencies, including the Airflow version, Kubernetes version, and any related libraries, are up to date. Sometimes, compatibility issues can cause unexpected errors.

6. **Community Support**: Reach out to the Airflow community forums or GitHub repository for additional support. Other users might have faced similar issues and could provide insights or solutions.

1. The error message ""/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: line 382: /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config: permission denied"" indicates a permission issue with the RabbitMQ configuration file.
2. In the Kubernetes deployment, the volume mount for RabbitMQ configuration at ""/etc/rabbitmq"" might be causing the permission denied error.
3. The hostPath volume in the PersistentVolume (PV) definition might not have the correct permissions set for RabbitMQ to access the configuration file.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Update the PersistentVolume (PV) definition to ensure correct permissions for RabbitMQ to access the configuration file.
2. Modify the PV definition to set appropriate permissions for the hostPath volume.
3. Apply the changes and redeploy the RabbitMQ deployment in Kubernetes.

**Verification:**
Verify that the RabbitMQ deployment in Kubernetes no longer throws the permission denied error and functions correctly.

**References:**
- Kubernetes Persistent Volumes: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/
- Kubernetes Volume Permissions: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath

**Common Mistakes & Best Practices:**
- Ensure that the permissions on hostPath volumes in PersistentVolumes are set correctly for applications to access files.
- Double-check volume mounts and paths in Kubernetes deployments to avoid permission issues.",N,"i'm in a progress to migrate to kuberenetes from docker-compose.
one of the services we're using is rabbit-mq.
when i try to deploy rabbit-mq 3.6.16-management i receive the error:

/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: line 382: /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config: permission denied.

option #2 - use aws-iam-authenticator, the official docs provide a thorough example of how to use sso and kubectl (kubeconfig)
","**Issue Summary:**
The user is unable to perform any kubectl operations on an AWS EKS cluster despite being able to log in to AWS CLI and GUI. The error message indicates unauthorized access.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. The user is able to obtain an EKS token using `aws eks get-token`, which suggests that the AWS SSO authentication is working correctly.
2. The `kubeconfig` file is correctly configured with the EKS cluster details and the role ARN for authentication.
3. The `aws-auth` ConfigMap in the EKS cluster is properly configured to map roles to users/groups.
4. The user `team-sso-devops` has been granted the `cluster-admin` role in the `clusterrolebinding`.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1. Verify the IAM role permissions:
   - Ensure that the IAM role associated with `team-sso-devops` has the necessary permissions to interact with the EKS cluster.
   - Check if the IAM policies attached to the role allow the required actions.

2. Check RBAC configuration:
   - Verify that the `clusterrolebinding` for `team:sso:devops` is correctly referencing the `cluster-admin` role.
   - Confirm that the `team-sso-devops` user is correctly mapped to the IAM role in the `aws-auth` ConfigMap.

3. Validate Kubernetes RBAC settings:
   - Check if there are any conflicting or overriding RBAC rules that might be restricting access for the user.
   - Ensure that the RBAC rules are correctly applied at the cluster level.

4. Test kubectl access:
   - Try accessing the EKS cluster using `kubectl` with the `team-sso-devops` user to see if the issue persists.
   - Use `kubectl auth can-i` command to check if the user has the necessary permissions for the desired actions.

5. Troubleshoot EKS token:
   - Revoke the existing EKS token and generate a new one using `aws eks get-token` to ensure the token is not expired or invalid.
   - Update the `kubeconfig` file with the new token if needed.

**Verification:**
1. Attempt to perform kubectl operations using the `team-sso-devops` user after following the above steps.
2. Check for any error messages or unauthorized access responses.
3. Verify that the user can successfully interact with the EKS cluster without any authentication issues.",N,"i have created a fresh aws sso (used internal idp as identity source, so no use of active directory).

"
45,"so, if your gke project is project my-gke, and the project containing the services/things your gke containers need access to is project my-data, one approach is to:


create a service account in the my-data project. give it whatever gcp roles/permissions are needed (ex. roles/bigquery.
dataviewer if you have some bigquery tables that your my-gke gke containers need to read).


create a service account key for that service account. when you do this in the console following https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys, you should automatically download a .json file containing the sa credentials.

create a kubernetes secret resource for those service account credentials. it might look something like this:

apiversion: v1
kind: secret
metadata:
  name: my-data-service-account-credentials
type: opaque
data:
  sa_json: &lt;contents of running 'base64 the-downloaded-sa-credentials.json'&gt;

mount the credentials in the container that needs access:

[...]
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    volumemounts:
    - name: service-account-credentials-volume
      mountpath: /etc/gcp
      readonly: true
[...]
  volumes:
  - name: service-account-credentials-volume
    secret:
      secretname: my-data-service-account-credentials
      items:
      - key: sa_json
        path: sa_credentials.json

set the google_application_credentials environment variable in the container to point to the path of the mounted credentials:

[...]
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    env:
    - name: google_application_credentials
      value: /etc/gcp/sa_credentials.json



with that, any official gcp clients (ex. the gcp python client, gcp java client, gcloud cli, etc. should respect the google_application_credentials env var and, when making api requests, automatically use the credentials of the my-data service account that you created and mounted the credentials .json file for.
","To set the `google_application_credentials` environment variable in your Kubernetes cron job, you can follow these steps:

1. Update your cron job YAML file to include the `google_application_credentials` environment variable pointing to the service account JSON file path:

```yaml
- name: google_application_credentials
  value: ""/etc/gcp/sa_credentials.json""
```

2. Make sure that your service account JSON file is stored in a Kubernetes secret and mounted as a volume in your pod spec. Based on the YAML snippet you provided, it seems like you already have this setup:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: service-account-credentials-volume
  secret:
    secretname: my-data-service-account-credentials
    items:
    - key: sa_json
      path: sa_credentials.json
```

3. Ensure that the volume mount path matches the path specified in the `google_application_credentials` environment variable:

```yaml
volumemounts:
- name: service-account-credentials-volume
  mountpath: ""/etc/gcp""
  readonly: true
```

By following these steps, your Kubernetes cron job should be able to access the service account JSON file through the `google_application_credentials` environment variable. This will allow your GKE container to interact with resources in a different GCP project.",N,"with the help of kubernetes i am running daily jobs on gke, on a daily basis based on cron configured in kubernetes a new container spins up and try to insert some data into bigquery.

the setup that we have is we have 2 different projects in gcp in one project we maintain the data in bigquery in other project we have all the gke running so when gke has to interact with different project resource my guess is i have to set an environment variable with name  google_application_credentials which points to a service account json file, but since every day kubernetes is spinning up a new container i am not sure how and where i should set this variable.

thanks in advance!

46,"your patch has a number of problems; for example ""- path"" instead of ""path"" but also incorrect referencing of object levels. however, even if you fixed the mistakes this would not work as intended. let's see why.

kubectl patch is a request for a strategic merge patch. when patching arrays, like the .spec.rules and .spec.rules.http.paths in this case, a strategic merge patch can use the defined patch type and merge patch merge key for the object to do the right thing. however, in case of the ingress object no one bothered to define these. this means that any patch will overwrite the entire object; it will not be a nice merge that one is hoping for.

to accomplish the particular change referred to in the question you can do:

kubectl get ing/main-ingress -o json \ 
  | jq '(.spec.rules[].http.paths[].backend.servicename | select(. == ""be-srvc"")) |= ""some-srvc""' \
  | kubectl apply -f -


the above will change all occurrences of the be-srvc service to some-srvc. keep in mind that there is a short race condition here: if the ingress is modified after kubectl get ran the change will fail with the error operation cannot be fulfilled on ingresses.extensions ""xx"": the object has been modified; to handle that case you need implement a retry logic.

if the indexes are known in the arrays mentioned above you can accomplish the patch directly:

kubectl patch ing/main-ingress --type=json \
  -p='[{""op"": ""replace"", ""path"": ""/spec/rules/0/http/paths/1/backend/servicename"", ""value"":""some-srvc""}]'
kubectl patch ing/main-ingress --type=json \
  -p='[{""op"": ""replace"", ""path"": ""/spec/rules/1/http/paths/1/backend/servicename"", ""value"":""some-srvc""}]'


the two commands above will change the backends for sample.domain.com/api and sample2.domain.com/api to some-srvc.

the two commands can also be combined like this:

kubectl patch ing/main-ingress --type=json \
  -p='[{""op"": ""replace"", ""path"": ""/spec/rules/0/http/paths/1/backend/servicename"", ""value"":""some-srvc""}, {""op"": ""replace"", ""path"": ""/spec/rules/1/http/paths/1/backend/servicename"", ""value"":""some-srvc""}]'


this has the same effect and as an added bonus there is no race condition here; the patch guaranteed to be atomic.
","to update an existing ingress to add a new host, you can update it by editing the resource:

kubectl describe ingress test



name:             test
namespace:        default
address:          178.91.123.132

  normal   add     35s                loadbalancer-controller  default/test



kubectl edit ingress test

this pops up an editor with the existing configuration in yaml format.
modify it to include the new host:

spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: service1
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /foo
        pathtype: prefix
  - host: bar.baz.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /foo
        pathtype: prefix
..

after you save your changes, kubectl updates the resource in the api server, which tells the ingress controller to reconfigure the load balancer.
verify this:

kubectl describe ingress test



name:             test
namespace:        default
address:          178.91.123.132
default backend:  default-http-backend:80 (10.8.2.3:8080)
rules:
  host         path  backends
  ----         ----  --------
  foo.bar.com
               /foo   service1:80 (10.8.0.90:80)
  bar.baz.com
               /foo   service2:80 (10.8.0.91:80)
annotations:
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target:  /
events:

  ----     ------  ----               ----                     -------
  normal   add     45s                loadbalancer-controller  default/test

you can achieve the same outcome by invoking

you can not:


create one cron job resource with several crontab times

run the example cronjob by using this command:

kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/job/cronjob.yaml

the output is similar to this:

cronjob.batch/hello created

after creating the cron job, get its status using this command:

kubectl get cronjob hello

the output is similar to this:

name    schedule      suspend   active   last schedule   age
hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        &lt;none&gt;          10s

as you can see from the results of the command, the cron job has not scheduled or run any jobs yet.
watch  for the job to be created in around one minute:

kubectl get jobs --watch

the output is similar to this:

hello-4111706356   1/1           5s         5s

now you've seen one running job scheduled by the ""hello"" cron job.
you can stop watching the job and view the cron job again to see that it scheduled the job:

kubectl get cronjob hello

the output is similar to this:

name    schedule      suspend   active   last schedule   age
hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        50s             75s

you should see that the cron job hello successfully scheduled a job at the time specified in last schedule.
there are currently 0 active jobs, meaning that the job has completed or failed.
now, find the pods that the last scheduled job created and view the standard output of one of the pods.
note: the job name is different from the pod name.

# replace ""hello-4111706356"" with the job name in your system
pods=$(kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=hello-4111706356 --output=jsonpath={.items[*].metadata.name})

49,"a container exits when its main process exits. doing something like:

docker run -itd debian


to hold the container open is frankly a hack that should only be used for quick tests and examples. if you just want a container for testing for a few minutes, i would do:

docker run -d debian sleep 300


which has the advantage that the container will automatically exit if you forget about it. alternatively, you could put something like this in a while loop to keep it running forever, or just run an application such as top. all of these should be easy to do in kubernetes.

the real question is why would you want to do this? your container should be providing a service, whose process will keep the container running in the background.
","check out container runtimes  to understand your options for an alternative.
if you find a defect or other technical concern relating to migrating away from dockershim, you can report an issue  to the kubernetes project.
======================================== the container runtime talks to the kubelet over a unix socket using the cri protocol , which is based on the grpc framework.
the kubelet acts as a client, and the runtime acts as the server.
in some cases, you might find it useful to know which socket your nodes use.
for example, with the removal of dockershim in kubernetes v1.24 and later, you might want to know whether you use docker engine with dockershim.
note: if you currently use docker engine in your nodes with cri-dockerd, you aren't affected by the dockershim removal.
you can check which socket you use by checking the kubelet configuration on your nodes.
read the starting commands for the kubelet process:

tr \\0 ' ' &lt; /proc/""$(pgrep kubelet)""/cmdline

if you don't have tr or pgrep, check the command line for the kubelet process manually.
in the output, look for the --container-runtime flag and the --container-runtime-endpoint flag.
if your nodes use kubernetes v1.23 and earlier and these flags aren't present or if the --container-runtime flag is not remote, you use the dockershim socket with docker engine.
the --container-runtime command line argument is not available in kubernetes v1.27 and later.
if the --container-runtime-endpoint flag is present, check the socket name to find out which runtime you use.
for example,

unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock

is the containerd endpoint.
if you want to change the container runtime on a node from docker engine to containerd, you can find out more information on migrating from docker engine to containerd , or, if you want to continue using docker engine in kubernetes v1.24 and later, migrate to a cri-compatible adapter like cri-dockerd .
======================================== to attach a process that is already running in a container, see kubectl attach .
docker: docker ps

 https://github.com/deis/charts , is a template
for a kubernetes replication controller. it can use the following four template
values (usually defined in a  values.yaml  file):imageregistry : the source registry for the docker image. dockertag : the tag for the docker image. pullpolicy : the kubernetes pull policy. storage : the storage backend, whose default is set to  ""minio""all of these values are defined by the template author. helm does not require or
dictate parameters.to see many working charts, check out the cncf
 artifact
hub .predefined valuesvalues that are supplied via a  values.yaml  file (or via the  --set  flag) are
accessible from the  .values  object in a template. but there are other
pre-defined pieces of data you can access in your templates.the following values are pre-defined, are available to every template, and
cannot be overridden. as with all values, the names are  case sensitive .release.name : the name of the release (not the chart) release.namespace : the namespace the chart was released to. release.service : the service that conducted the release. release.isupgrade : this is set to true if the current operation is an
upgrade or rollback. release.isinstall : this is set to true if the current operation is an
install. chart : the contents of the  chart.yaml . thus, the chart version is
obtainable as  chart.version  and the maintainers are in  chart.maintainers . files : a map-like object containing all non-special files in the chart. this
will not give you access to templates, but will give you access to additional
files that are present (unless they are excluded using  .helmignore ). files
can be accessed using  {{ index .files ""file.name"" }}  or using the
 {{.files.get name }}  function. you can also access the contents of the file
as  []byte  using  {{ .files.getbytes }} capabilities : a map-like object that contains information about the versions
of kubernetes ( {{ .capabilities.kubeversion }} ) and the supported kubernetes
api versions ( {{ .capabilities.apiversions.has ""batch/v1"" }} )note:  any unknown  chart.yaml  fields will be dropped. they will not be
accessible inside of the  chart  object. thus,  chart.yaml  cannot be used to
pass arbitrarily structured data into the template. the values file can be used
for that, t a chart is organized as a collection of files inside of a directory. the
directory name is the name of the chart (without versioning information). thus,
a chart describing wordpress would be stored in a  wordpress/  directory.inside of this directory, helm will expect a structure that matches this:wordpress/
   chart.yaml          # a yaml file containing information about the chart
   license             # optional: a plain text file containing the license for the chart
   readme.md           # optional: a human-readable readme file
   values.yaml         # the default configuration values for this chart
   values.schema.json  # optional: a json schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file
   charts/             # a directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends.
   crds/               # custom resource definitions
   templates/          # a directory of templates that, when combined with values,
                       # will generate valid kubernetes manifest files.
   templates/notes.txt # optional: a plain text file containing short usage noteshelm reserves use of the  charts/ ,  crds/ , and  templates/  directories, and
of the listed file names. other files will be left as they are. there are three potential sources of values:a chart's  values.yaml  file a values file supplied by  helm install -f  or  helm upgrade -f the values passed to a  --set  or  --set-string  flag on  helm install  or
 helm upgradewhen designing the structure of your values, keep in mind that users of your
chart may want to override them via either the  -f  flag or with the  --set 
option.since  --set  is more limited in expressiveness, the first guidelines for
writing your  values.yaml  file is  make it easy to override from  --set .for this reason, it's often better to structure your values file using maps.difficult to use with  --set :servers : 
    -  name :   foo 
      port :   80 
    -  name :   bar 
      port :   81the above cannot be expressed with  --set  in helm  <=2.4 . in helm 2.5,
accessing the port on foo is  --set servers[0].port=80 . not only is it harder
for the user to figure out, but it is prone to errors if at some later time the
order of the  servers  is changed.easy to use:servers : 
    foo : 
      port :   80 
    bar : 
      port :   81accessing foo's port is much more obvious:  --set servers.foo.port=80 .",Y,"i have a downloaded file through helm inspect called sftp.yaml
i have a parameter in that sftp.yaml file:-
sftp:
    allowedmacs: &quot;hmac-sha2-512&quot;
    allowedciphers: aes256-ctr

now if i install the corresponding helm chart after commenting out the entire line of &quot;allowedmacs&quot; from custom values files i.e. &quot;sftp.yaml&quot;, then k8s takes the delta of sftp.yaml and the actual values.yaml and then use values.yaml's &quot;allowedmacs&quot;.
however what i want is if &quot;allowedmacs&quot; line is commented in &quot;sftp.yaml&quot; custom values file, then it should not set the env variable at all, or sets it as null.
presently my deployment file's env section looks like
  - name: macs
    value: {{ default &quot;&quot; .values.sftp.allowedmacs | quote }}

51,"from eks 1.23 on a container storage interface (csi) driver is needed in order to get your persisentvolumeclaims served by a persistentvolume as you are used to from earlier eks versions.
the docs tell us, what needs to be configured:
solution: configure amazon ebs csi driver for working persistentvolumes in eks
in essence we need to enable the aws ebs csi driver as an eks addon. but beforehand we need to enable the iam oidc provider and create the iam role for the ebs csi driver. the easiest way to do both is to use eksctl (other ways like using plain aws cli or the aws gui are described in the docs).
1.) install eksctl
we assume here that the aws cli is installed and configured - and you have access to your eks cluster. to use eksctl we need to install it first. on a mac use brew like:
brew tap weaveworks/tap
brew install weaveworks/tap/eksctl

or on linux use:
curl --silent --location &quot;https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz&quot; | tar xz -c /tmp
sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin

2.) enable iam oidc provider
a prerequisite for the ebs csi driver to work is to have an existing aws identity and access management (iam) openid connect (oidc) provider for your cluster. this iam oidc provider can be enabled with the following command:
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --region=eu-central-1 --cluster=yourclusternamehere --approve

3.) create amazon ebs csi driver iam role
now having eksctl in place, create the iam role:
eksctl create iamserviceaccount \
  --region eu-central-1 \
  --name ebs-csi-controller-sa \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --cluster yourclusternamehere \
  --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/amazonebscsidriverpolicy \
  --approve \
  --role-only \
  --role-name amazoneks_ebs_csi_driverrole

as you can see aws maintains a managed policy for us we can simply use (aws maintains a managed policy, available at arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/amazonebscsidriverpolicy). only if you use encrypted ebs drives you need to additionally add configuration to the policy.
the command...

...deploys an aws cloudformation stack that creates an iam role,
attaches the iam policy to it, and annotates the existing
ebs-csi-controller-sa service account with the amazon resource name
(arn) of the iam role.

4.) add the amazon ebs csi add-on
now we can finally add the ebs csi add-on. therefor we also need the aws account id which we can obtain by running aws sts get-caller-identity --query account --output text (see quick way to get aws account number from the aws cli tools?). now the eksctl create addon command looks like this:
eksctl create addon --name aws-ebs-csi-driver --cluster yourclusternamehere --service-account-role-arn arn:aws:iam::$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query account --output text):role/amazoneks_ebs_csi_driverrole --force

now your persistentvolumeclaim should get the status bound while a ebs volume got created for you - and the tekton pipeline should run again.
","in this exercise, you create a hostpath persistentvolume.
kubernetes supports hostpath for development and testing on a single-node cluster.
a hostpath persistentvolume uses a file or directory on the node to emulate network-attached storage.
in a production cluster, you would not use hostpath.
instead a cluster administrator would provision a network resource like a google compute engine persistent disk, an nfs share, or an amazon elastic block store volume.
cluster administrators can also use storageclasses  to set up dynamic provisioning .
here is the configuration file for the hostpath persistentvolume: pods/storage/pv-volume.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: persistentvolume
metadata:
  name: task-pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageclassname: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 10gi
  accessmodes:
    - readwriteonce
  hostpath:
    path: ""/mnt/data""

the configuration file specifies that the volume is at /mnt/data on the cluster's node.
the configuration also specifies a size of 10 gibibytes and an access mode of readwriteonce, which means the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
it defines the storageclass name  manual for the persistentvolume, which will be used to bind persistentvolumeclaim requests to this persistentvolume.
note: this example uses the readwriteonce access mode, for simplicity.
for production use, the kubernetes project recommends using the readwriteoncepod access mode instead.
create the persistentvolume:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/pv-volume.yaml

view information about the persistentvolume:

kubectl get pv task-pv-volume

the output shows that the persistentvolume has a status of available.
this means it has not yet been bound to a persistentvolumeclaim.

name             capacity   accessmodes   reclaimpolicy   status      claim     storageclass   reason    age
task-pv-volume   10gi       rwo           retain          available             manual                   4s

======================================== the volumebindingmode field controls when volume binding and dynamic provisioning  should occur.
when unset, immediate mode is used by default.
the immediate mode indicates that volume binding and dynamic provisioning occurs once the persistentvolumeclaim is created.
for storage backends that are topology-constrained and not globally accessible from all nodes in the cluster, persistentvolumes will be bound or provisioned without knowledge of the pod's scheduling requirements.
this may result in unschedulable pods.
a cluster administrator can address this issue by specifying the waitforfirstconsumer mode which will delay the binding and provisioning of a persistentvolume until a pod using the persistentvolumeclaim is created.
persistentvolumes will be selected or provisioned conforming to the topology that is specified by the pod's scheduling constraints.
these include, but are not limited to, resource requirements , node selectors , pod affinity and anti-affinity , and taints and tolerations .
the following plugins support waitforfirstconsumer with dynamic provisioning: csi volumes, provided that the specific csi driver supports this the following plugins support waitforfirstconsumer with pre-created persistentvolume binding: csi volumes, provided that the specific csi driver supports this local  note: if you choose to use waitforfirstconsumer, do not use nodename in the pod spec to specify node affinity.
if nodename is used in this case, the scheduler will be bypassed and pvc will remain in pending state.
instead, you can use node selector for

======================================== kubernetes
1.31
is now available in amazon eks.
for more information about kubernetes
1.31
, see the official release announcement .
important the kubelet flag --keep-terminated-pod-volumes deprecated since 2017 has been removed as part of the
v1.31
release.
this change impacts how terminated pod volumes are handled by the kubelet.
if you are using this flag in your node configurations, you must update your bootstrap scripts and launch templates to remove it before upgrading.
the beta volumeattributesclass feature gate and api resource is enabled in amazon eks
v1.31
.
this feature allows cluster operators to modify mutable properties of persistent volumes (pvs) managed by compatible csi drivers, including the amazon ebs csi driver.
to leverage this feature, ensure that your csi driver supports the volumeattributesclass feature (for the amazon ebs csi driver, upgrade to version
v1.35.0
or later to automatically enable the feature).
you will be able to create volumeattributesclass objects to define the desired volume attributes, such as volume type and throughput, and associate them with your persistent volume claims (pvcs).
see the official kubernetes documentation as well as the documentation of your csi driver for more information.
for more information about the amazon ebs csi driver, see store kubernetes volumes with amazon ebs .
kubernetes support for apparmor has graduated to stable and is now generally available for public use.
this feature allows you to protect your containers with apparmor by setting the
apparmorprofile.type
field in the containerâs securitycontext.
prior to kubernetes
v1.30
, apparmor was controlled by annotations.
starting with
v1.30
, it is controlled using fields.
to leverage this feature, we recommend migrating away from annotations and using the
apparmorprofile.type
field to ensure that your workloads are compatible.
the persistentvolume last phase transition time feature has graduated to stable and is now generally available for public use in kubernetes
v1.31
.
this feature introduces a new field,
.status.lasttransitiontime
, in the persistentvolumestatus, which provides a timestamp of when a persistentvolume last transitioned to a different phase.
this enhancement allows for better tracking and management of persistentvolumes, particularly in scenarios where understanding the lifecycle of volumes is important.
