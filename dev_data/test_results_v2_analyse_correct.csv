### Explanation
I believe this pull request includes the changes you are inquiring about. The `Ingress` and `IngressClass` resources have transitioned to `networking.k8s.io/v1`. The `Ingress` and `IngressClass` types in the `extensions/v1beta1` and `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API versions are now deprecated and will not be available in version 1.22 and later. Existing objects can still be accessed through the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API. Key changes in the v1 `Ingress` objects (the field names from v1beta1 remain unchanged) include:
* `spec.backend` is now `spec.defaultBackend`
* `serviceName` is now `service.name`
* `servicePort` is now `service.port.name` (for string values)
* `servicePort` is now `service.port.number` (for numeric values)
* The `pathType` no longer has a default value in v1; you must specify ""Exact"", ""Prefix"", or ""ImplementationSpecific"".

Additional updates to the `Ingress` API include:
* Backends can now be either resource or service backends.
* The `path` is no longer required to be a valid regular expression.

If you refer to the documentation for Ingress in version 1.19, the new syntax appears to be as shown above. Unfortunately, I do not have access to a 1.19 cluster to verify this myself, but I believe this is the issue you are encountering.","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

========================================","ingress backed by a single service there are existing kubernetes concepts that allow you to expose a single service (see alternatives ).
you can also do this with an ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.

kubectl get ingress test-ingress

test-ingress   external-lb   *       203.0.113.123   80      59s

where

203.0.113.123

is the ip allocated by the ingress controller to satisfy this ingress.
note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.
an ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.
for example, a setup like:  figure.
ingress fan out it would require an ingress such as: service/networking/simple-fanout-example.yaml

  normal   add     22s                loadbalancer-controller  default/test

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.
 figure.
ingress name based virtual hosting the following ingress tells the backing load balancer to route requests based on the host header .
service/networking/name-virtual-host-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: name-virtual-host-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathtype: prefix
        path: ""/""
        backend:
          service:
            name: service1
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: bar.foo.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathtype: prefix
        path: ""/""
        backend:
          service:
            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

second.bar.com

to service2, and any traffic whose request host header doesn't match

first.bar.com

and

second.bar.com

to service3.

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.
 figure.
ingress name based virtual hosting the following ingress tells the backing load balancer to route requests based on the host header .

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

second.bar.com

to service2, and any traffic whose request host header doesn't match

first.bar.com

and

1. **Ingress Name and Namespace**: 
   - The ""reference answer"" uses `name: minimal-ingress` and does not specify a namespace, while the ""rag answer"" uses `name: test-ingress` and specifies `namespace: test-layer`. While this is not inherently incorrect, it does not align with the reference answer's context.

2. **Path and PathType**:
   - The ""reference answer"" specifies a path of `/testpath`, while the ""rag answer"" uses `/`. This is a difference in the path being defined, which may or may not be appropriate depending on the use case.

3. **Backend Service Name and Port**:
   - The ""reference answer"" specifies a backend service named `test` on port `80`, while the ""rag answer"" specifies a backend service named `test-app` on port `5000`. This is a significant difference as it changes the service being targeted and the port number.

4. **Host Specification**:
   - The ""rag answer"" includes a `host: mylocalhost.com`, which is not present in the ""reference answer"". This is an additional configuration that may or may not be appropriate depending on the intended use of the Ingress.

5. **Rewrite Target**:
   - The ""rag answer"" uses `rewrite-target: /$1`, while the ""reference answer"" uses `rewrite-target: /`. This difference in the rewrite target could lead to different behaviors in request handling.

Overall, while the ""rag answer"" is syntactically correct and follows the structure of an Ingress resource, it diverges significantly from the ""reference answer"" in terms of configuration and intended functionality, making it incorrect in the context of matching the reference."

### Explanation
You can utilize the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size` to directly set the `max-body-size` option within your Ingress resource, eliminating the need to modify a base ConfigMap. This allows for more granular control over the request body size limits for your application.","official document: for nginx, an 413 error will be returned to the client when the size in a request exceeds the maximum allowed size of the client request body. this size can be configured by the parameter [`client_max_body_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size).  to configure this setting globally for all ingress rules, the `proxy-body-size` value may be set in the [nginx configmap](./configmap.md#proxy-body-size). to use custom values in an ingress rule define these annotation:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 8m ``` loft blog: this rule can be used to set the maximum size of the body in a request. if the body exceeds the maximum size set, nginx will return a 413 error to the client. the body size can be configured by using the following nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioproxy-body-size 8m copy heres an example apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata name test-ingress annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioproxy-body-size 8m spec rules - http paths - path testpath backend servicename test copy","official document: sets the size of the buffer [`proxy_buffer_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffer_size) used for reading the first part of the response received from the proxied server. by default proxy buffer size is set as ""4k""  to configure this setting globally, set `proxy-buffer-size` in [nginx configmap](./configmap.md#proxy-buffer-size). to use custom values in an ingress rule, define this annotation: ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: ""8k"" ```","official document: enable or disable proxy buffering [`proxy_buffering`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffering). by default proxy buffering is disabled in the nginx config.  to configure this setting globally for all ingress rules, the `proxy-buffering` value may be set in the [nginx configmap](./configmap.md#proxy-buffering). to use custom values in an ingress rule define these annotation:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffering: ""on"" ```","official document: for nginx, an 413 error will be returned to the client when the size in a request exceeds the maximum allowed size of the client request body. this size can be configured by the parameter [`client_max_body_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size).  to configure this setting globally for all ingress rules, the `proxy-body-size` value may be set in the [nginx configmap](./configmap.md#proxy-body-size). to use custom values in an ingress rule define these annotation:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 8m ``` loft blog: this rule can be used to set the maximum size of the body in a request. if the body exceeds the maximum size set, nginx will return a 413 error to the client. the body size can be configured by using the following nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioproxy-body-size 8m copy heres an example apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata name test-ingress annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioproxy-body-size 8m spec rules - http paths - path testpath backend servicename test copy official document: sets the size of the buffer [`proxy_buffer_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffer_size) used for reading the first part of the response received from the proxied server. by default proxy buffer size is set as ""4k""  to configure this setting globally, set `proxy-buffer-size` in [nginx configmap](./configmap.md#proxy-buffer-size). to use custom values in an ingress rule, define this annotation: ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffer-size: ""8k"" ``` official document: enable or disable proxy buffering [`proxy_buffering`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffering). by default proxy buffering is disabled in the nginx config.  to configure this setting globally for all ingress rules, the `proxy-buffering` value may be set in the [nginx configmap](./configmap.md#proxy-buffering). to use custom values in an ingress rule define these annotation:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-buffering: ""on"" ```","```yaml

### Specific Issues:
1. **Incorrect Resource Type**: The ""rag answer"" uses a `ConfigMap` to set the `proxy-body-size`, which is not the most direct method for configuring the body size for a specific Ingress resource. The reference answer correctly uses an annotation within the Ingress resource itself, which is the recommended approach for setting this configuration.

2. **Redundant Configuration**: The ""rag answer"" includes both `proxy-body-size` and `client-max-body-size` in the ConfigMap, which can lead to confusion. The correct way to set the body size for a specific Ingress is through the annotation, as shown in the reference answer.

3. **Misleading Instructions**: While the ""rag answer"" does mention using the annotation as a fallback, it primarily focuses on modifying the ConfigMap, which is not the best practice for this specific use case.

In summary, the ""rag answer"" does not align with the best practices for configuring body size limits in Kubernetes Ingress resources, making it incorrect in this context."

### Explanation
For a complete overview of authentication, please consult the official Kubernetes documentation on authentication and authorization. It is advisable to use an identity provider for Kubernetes, such as OpenID Connect, for user authentication. If you are utilizing GKE or ACS, you can integrate with their respective identity and access management frameworks. For self-hosted Kubernetes setups (like those using Kops), CoreOS/Dex can be employed to connect with LDAP or OAuth2 identity providers. A detailed two-part article on SSO for Kubernetes serves as a good reference. 

Kops (version 1.10 and later) now features built-in authentication support, which simplifies the integration with AWS IAM as an identity provider for AWS users. There are also several open-source CLI clients available for Dex, such as nordstrom/kubelogin and pusher/k8s-auth-example. 

If you are seeking a quick and easy (though not the most secure or manageable in the long run) method to get started, you can utilize service accounts with two options for specialized policies to control access. It is important to note that since version 1.6, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is strongly recommended, and this response does not cover RBAC setup. 

Additionally, there is an outdated (2017-2018) guide by Bitnami on user setup with RBAC that may still be relevant. The steps to enable service account access are outlined above, and depending on your cluster configuration, these accounts may have full admin rights. A bash script is provided to automate the service account creation process. 

To control user access with policies using ABAC, you will need to create a policy file, which is also included in the above YAML. This policy should be provisioned on every master node, and the API servers should be configured with the appropriate flags to enforce the policy, granting the specified user read-only access to resources in the designated namespace.","suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for test work.
in the development cluster, your frontend developers work in a namespace called frontend, and your storage developers work in a namespace called storage.
in your test cluster, developers work in the default namespace, or they create auxiliary namespaces as they see fit.
access to the development cluster requires authentication by certificate.
access to the test cluster requires authentication by username and password.
create a directory named config-exercise.
in your config-exercise directory, create a file named config-demo with this content:

your config-demo file has the framework to describe two clusters, two users, and three contexts.

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster test --server=https://5.6.7.8 --insecure-skip-tls-verify

add user details to your configuration file: caution: storing passwords in kubernetes client config is risky.
a better alternative would be to use a credential plugin and store them separately.
see: client-go credential plugins 

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials developer --client-certificate=fake-cert-file --client-key=fake-key-seefile
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials experimenter --username=exp --password=some-password

note: to delete a user you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset users.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a cluster, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset clusters.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a context, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset contexts.&lt;name&gt;

add context details to your configuration file:

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-frontend --cluster=development --namespace=frontend --user=developer
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-storage --cluster=development --namespace=storage --user=developer

approve the certificatesigningrequest use kubectl to create a csr and approve it.
get the list of csrs:

kubectl get csr

approve the csr:

kubectl certificate approve myuser

get the certificate retrieve the certificate from the csr:

kubectl get csr/myuser -o yaml

the certificate value is in base64-encoded format under

this is a sample command to create a role for this new user:

kubectl create role developer --verb=create --verb=get --verb=list --verb=update --verb=delete --resource=pods

this is a sample command to create a rolebinding for this new user:

kubectl create rolebinding developer-binding-myuser --role=developer --user=myuser

add to kubeconfig the last step is to add this user into the kubeconfig file.
first, you need to add new credentials:

kubectl config set-credentials myuser --client-key=myuser.key --client-certificate=myuser.crt --embed-certs=true

```

**Note:** Replace `<base64_encoded_csr>` with the actual base64 encoded CSR content for the new user.","To add users to your Kubernetes cluster, you need to follow a series of steps to create their credentials and grant them the necessary permissions. Here’s a detailed guide based on the retrieved knowledge:

1. **Generate a Private Key and CSR**: First, you need to create a private key and a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the new user. This is important because the user will authenticate using a certificate.

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out newuser.key 2048
   openssl req -new -key newuser.key -out newuser.csr -subj ""/cn=newuser""
   ```

2. **Create a CertificateSigningRequest**: You will then create a `CertificateSigningRequest` resource in Kubernetes using the CSR you generated. Make sure to base64 encode the CSR content.

   ```bash
   cat newuser.csr | base64 | tr -d ""\n""  # Get the base64 encoded CSR
   ```

   Use the output from the above command to create the `CertificateSigningRequest`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
   kind: CertificateSigningRequest
   metadata:
     name: newuser
   spec:
     request: <base64_encoded_csr>
     signerName: kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client
     expirationSeconds: 86400  # one day
     usages:
     - client auth
   ```

3. **Submit the CSR**: Apply the CSR to the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <csr_file>.yaml
   ```

4. **Approve the CSR**: After submitting the CSR, you need to approve it:

   ```bash
   kubectl certificate approve newuser
   ```

5. **Retrieve the Certificate**: Once the CSR is approved, you can retrieve the issued certificate:

   ```bash
   kubectl get csr newuser -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}' | base64 -d > newuser.crt
   ```

6. **Create Role and RoleBinding**: Define the permissions for the new user by creating a `Role` and a `RoleBinding`. Here’s an example of how to create a role that allows the user to manage pods:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Role
   metadata:
     name: admin-role
     namespace: default
   rules:
   - apiGroups: [""""]
     resources: [""pods"", ""services"", ""deployments""]
     verbs: [""get"", ""list"", ""create"", ""update"", ""delete""]
   ```

   Then, create a `RoleBinding` to bind the role to the user:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: RoleBinding
   metadata:
     name: admin-rolebinding
     namespace: default
   subjects:
   - kind: User
     name: newuser
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   roleRef:
     kind: Role
     name: admin-role
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   ```

7. **Add User to kubeconfig**: Finally, add the new user’s credentials to your kubeconfig file:

   ```bash
   kubectl config set-credentials newuser --client-key=newuser.key --client-certificate=newuser.crt --embed-certs=true
   kubectl config set-context newuser --cluster={cluster_name} --user=newuser
   ```

8. **Switch Context**: To test the new user’s access, switch to the new context:

   ```bash
   kubectl config use-context newuser
   ```

### Security Note:
Regarding your question about sharing the `cluster.certificate-authority-data`, it is generally safe to share this data as it is used to verify the authenticity of the Kubernetes API server. However, you should always be cautious about sharing sensitive information and ensure that only trusted users have access to your cluster's credentials.","1612, 1997, 505","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**. 

### Specific Points of Incorrectness:

1. **Authentication Method**: The ""rag answer"" focuses on using a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for user authentication, which is one method, but it does not mention the recommended approach of using an identity provider like OpenID Connect, as highlighted in the ""reference answer."" The reference answer emphasizes the use of identity providers for user authentication, which is a more modern and manageable approach.

2. **Lack of Mention of RBAC**: While the ""rag answer"" does mention creating roles and role bindings, it does not emphasize the importance of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as strongly as the ""reference answer."" The reference answer states that RBAC is strongly recommended since version 1.6, which is a critical point for managing permissions effectively in Kubernetes.

3. **Service Accounts**: The ""rag answer"" does not discuss the use of service accounts, which is mentioned in the ""reference answer"" as a quick way to get started with user access management. The reference answer provides a detailed process for creating service accounts, which is a common practice in Kubernetes.

4. **Policy Management**: The ""rag answer"" does not address the use of ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) policies, which is mentioned in the ""reference answer."" While the ""rag answer"" focuses on RBAC, it misses the broader context of policy management that the reference answer provides.

5. **Security Note**: The ""rag answer"" includes a security note about sharing the `cluster.certificate-authority-data`, which is not mentioned in the ""reference answer."" While this information may be relevant, it diverges from the main focus of user authentication and authorization, which is the core topic of the question.

In summary, while the ""rag answer"" provides a valid method for adding users to a Kubernetes cluster, it lacks the comprehensive approach and best practices outlined in the ""reference answer,"" making it incorrect in the context of providing a complete and recommended solution for user authentication and authorization in Kubernetes."

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: sa1-token
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: sa1
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
```
### Explanation
In Kubernetes 1.24, service account token secrets are no longer generated automatically. Refer to the ""urgent upgrade notes"" in the 1.24 changelog for more details. The `legacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate is in beta and is enabled by default. When this feature is active, secret API objects containing service account tokens will not be auto-generated for every service account. Instead, you can use the TokenRequest API to obtain service account tokens. If you require a non-expiring token, you can create a secret API object for the token controller to populate with a service account token by following the provided guide. 

This means that in Kubernetes 1.24, you will need to create the secret manually, and the token key in the data field will be set automatically for you. Since you are creating the secret manually, you will know its name and won't need to look it up in the service account object. This method should also work in earlier versions of Kubernetes.","every namespace has at least one serviceaccount: the default serviceaccount resource, called default.
you can list all serviceaccount resources in your current namespace  with:

kubectl get serviceaccounts

the output is similar to this:

name      secrets    age
default   1          1d

you can create additional serviceaccount objects like this:

kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;eof
apiversion: v1
kind: serviceaccount
metadata:
  name: build-robot
eof

the name of a serviceaccount object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
if you get a complete dump of the service account object, like this:

kubectl get serviceaccounts/build-robot -o yaml

the output is similar to this:

apiversion: v1
kind: serviceaccount
metadata:
  creationtimestamp: 2019-06-16t00:12:34z
  name: build-robot
  namespace: default
  resourceversion: ""272500""
  uid: 721ab723-13bc-11e5-aec2-42010af0021e

you can use authorization plugins to set permissions on service accounts .
to use a non-default service account, set the

spec.serviceaccountname

field of a pod to the name of the serviceaccount you wish to use.
you can only set the serviceaccountname field when creating a pod, or in a template for a new pod.
you cannot update the

.spec.serviceaccountname

field of a pod that already exists.
note: the

.spec.serviceaccount

field is a deprecated alias for

.spec.serviceaccountname

.
if you want to remove the fields from a workload resource, set both fields to empty explicitly on the pod template .
cleanup if you tried creating build-robot serviceaccount from the example above, you can clean it up by running:

kubectl delete serviceaccount/build-robot

========================================","caution: only create long-lived api tokens if the token request  mechanism is not suitable.
the token request mechanism provides time-limited tokens; because these expire, they represent a lower risk to information security.
to create a non-expiring, persisted api token for a serviceaccount, create a secret of type

kubernetes.io/service-account-token

with an annotation referencing the serviceaccount.
the control plane then generates a long-lived token and updates that secret with that generated token data.
here is a sample manifest for such a secret: secret/serviceaccount/mysecretname.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: secret
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
metadata:
  name: mysecretname
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: myserviceaccount

to create a secret based on this example, run:

kubectl -n examplens create -f https://k8s.io/examples/secret/serviceaccount/mysecretname.yaml

to see the details for that secret, run:

kubectl -n examplens describe secret mysecretname

the output is similar to:

name:           mysecretname

========================================","every namespace has at least one serviceaccount: the default serviceaccount resource, called default.
you can list all serviceaccount resources in your current namespace  with:

kubectl get serviceaccounts

the output is similar to this:

name      secrets    age
default   1          1d

you can create additional serviceaccount objects like this:

kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;eof

eof

the name of a serviceaccount object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
if you get a complete dump of the service account object, like this:

kubectl get serviceaccounts/build-robot -o yaml

the output is similar to this:

you can use authorization plugins to set permissions on service accounts .
to use a non-default service account, set the

spec.serviceaccountname

field of a pod to the name of the serviceaccount you wish to use.
you can only set the serviceaccountname field when creating a pod, or in a template for a new pod.
you cannot update the

.spec.serviceaccountname

field of a pod that already exists.
note: the

.spec.serviceaccount

field is a deprecated alias for

.spec.serviceaccountname

.
if you want to remove the fields from a workload resource, set both fields to empty explicitly on the pod template .
cleanup if you tried creating build-robot serviceaccount from the example above, you can clean it up by running:

kubectl delete serviceaccount/build-robot

======================================== caution: only create long-lived api tokens if the token request  mechanism is not suitable.
the token request mechanism provides time-limited tokens; because these expire, they represent a lower risk to information security.
to create a non-expiring, persisted api token for a serviceaccount, create a secret of type

kubernetes.io/service-account-token

with an annotation referencing the serviceaccount.
the control plane then generates a long-lived token and updates that secret with that generated token data.
here is a sample manifest for such a secret: secret/serviceaccount/mysecretname.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: secret
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
metadata:
  name: mysecretname
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: myserviceaccount

to create a secret based on this example, run:

kubectl -n examplens create -f https://k8s.io/examples/secret/serviceaccount/mysecretname.yaml

to see the details for that secret, run:

kubectl -n examplens describe secret mysecretname

the output is similar to:

To see the secret associated with the service account, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secrets

This will list all secrets in the current namespace, including the one associated with your service account. The secret will typically have a name that follows the pattern `<service-account-name>-token-<random-suffix>`.

```bash

### Specific Points of Incorrectness:
1. **Automatic Secret Creation**: The rag answer states that when you create a service account using `kubectl create serviceaccount sa1`, Kubernetes automatically creates a secret for that service account. This is misleading in the context of Kubernetes 1.24 and later, where service account token secrets are no longer generated automatically due to the changes mentioned in the reference answer.

2. **Visibility of Secrets**: The rag answer implies that the secret should be visible immediately after creating the service account, which is not accurate in Kubernetes 1.24 and later. The reference answer clarifies that you need to create the secret manually in this version.

3. **Feature Gate Context**: The rag answer does not mention the `legacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate or the need to use the TokenRequest API, which is crucial information for understanding the behavior of service account tokens in Kubernetes 1.24.

### Conclusion:
The rag answer fails to accurately reflect the changes introduced in Kubernetes 1.24 regarding service account token secrets, making it incorrect in this context."

### Explanation
I utilized `envsubst` (as detailed in the [GNU documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/envsubst-invocation.html)) to achieve this. First, create a `deployment.yaml` file with the above content. 

After that, you can set the environment variable and apply the configuration using the following commands:

```bash
export name=my-test-nginx
envsubst < deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

I'm not certain which operating system you are using for this process. If you're on macOS, you can install `envsubst` with:

```bash
brew install gettext
brew link --force gettext

```","The error you encountered, ""error: no objects passed to create,"" is likely due to the way you are trying to use the `-l key1=value1` label option when creating the deployment. The `-l` flag is used to specify labels for the resources being created, but it does not apply to the deployment's metadata directly in the way you are attempting.

In your `deployment.yaml`, you are using `$key1` as the name of the deployment, which is not being resolved correctly. Instead, you should use a static name for the deployment. Additionally, you can define environment variables directly within the deployment specification.

Here’s the corrected `deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
# deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  labels: 
    service: sigma-service
  name: sigma-service  # Use a static name instead of $key1

            - name: KEY1
              value: ""value1""  # Set your environment variable here
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Static Name**: Changed the deployment name from `$key1` to a static name `sigma-service`.
2. **Environment Variable**: Added the environment variable directly in the deployment spec under the `env` section.

### Usage:
To create the deployment, you can simply run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

This should successfully create the deployment with the specified environment variable. If you want to add labels to the deployment, you can do so directly in the `metadata` section of the `deployment.yaml` file.","2950, 1785, 2697","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**. Here are the specific points of error and areas where it deviates from the ""reference answer"":

1. **Dynamic Name Resolution**: The ""rag answer"" suggests using a static name (`sigma-service`) instead of the dynamic name (`$key1`) used in the ""reference answer"". While using a static name is valid, it does not address the original intent of using environment variable substitution, which is a key feature of the ""reference answer"".

2. **Container Name and Image**: The ""rag answer"" changes the container name from `nginx` to `django-app` and the image from `nginx:1.7.9` to `your-django-image:latest`. This fundamentally alters the deployment's purpose and does not align with the original example, which specifically uses an Nginx container.

3. **Labeling**: The ""rag answer"" changes the labels from `app: nginx` to `service: sigma-service`. While this is not inherently incorrect, it diverges from the original labeling scheme, which may lead to confusion or misalignment with other resources that expect the original labels.

4. **Environment Variables**: The ""rag answer"" introduces an environment variable directly in the deployment spec, which is a valid approach but does not reflect the use of `envsubst` as shown in the ""reference answer"". The original answer emphasizes the use of environment variable substitution in the context of the deployment name.

In summary, while the ""rag answer"" contains some valid Kubernetes concepts, it strays too far from the original intent and structure of the ""reference answer"" to be considered correct."

### Explanation
When you enter a loop block in Helm templates, you lose access to the global context if you use `..`. To access the global context, you can use `$.` instead. According to the Helm documentation, there is one variable that is always global: `$`. This variable always points to the root context, which can be particularly useful when looping through a range and needing to reference the chart's release name. In your example, using this approach allows you to correctly reference the release name while iterating through the nodes.","the next control structure to look at is the  with  action. this controls
variable scoping. recall that  .  is a reference to  the current scope . so
 .values  tells the template to find the  values  object in the current scope.the syntax for  with  is similar to a simple  if  statement:{{ with pipeline }}
   # restricted scope
 {{ end }}scopes can be changed.  with  can allow you to set the current scope ( . ) to a
particular object. for example, we've been working with  .values.favorite .
let's rewrite our configmap to alter the  .  scope to point to
 .values.favorite :apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }}note that we removed the  if  conditional from the previous exercise
because it is now unnecessary - the block after  with  only executes
if the value of  pipeline  is not empty.notice that now we can reference  .drink  and  .food  without qualifying them.
that is because the  with  statement sets  .  to point to  .values.favorite .
the  .  is reset to its previous scope after  {{ end }} .but here's a note of caution! inside of the restricted scope, you will not be
able to access the other objects from the parent scope using  . . this, for
example, will fail:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }} 
    {{- end }}it will produce an error because  release.name  is not inside of the restricted
scope for  . . however, if we swap the last two lines, all will work as expected
because the scope is reset after  {{ end }} .{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }}or, we can use  $  for accessing the object  release.name  from the parent
scope.  $  is mapped to the root scope when template execution begins and it
does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   $.release.name }} 
    {{- end }}after looking at  range , we will take a look at template variables, which offer
one solution to the scoping issue above.","global values are values that can be accessed from any chart or subchart by
exactly the same name. globals require explicit declaration. you can't use an
existing non-global as if it were a global.the values data type has a reserved section called  values.global  where global
values can be set. let's set one in our  mychart/values.yaml  file.favorite : 
    drink :   coffee 
    food :   pizza

    - cheese

planning to make sure the right templates are configured to use globals.","many programming languages have support for looping using  for  loops,  foreach 
loops, or similar functional mechanisms. in helm's template language, the way to
iterate through a collection is to use the  range  operator.to start, let's add a list of pizza toppings to our  values.yaml  file:favorite :

    food :   pizza 
 pizzatoppings : 
    - mushrooms 
    - cheese

modify our template to print this list into our configmap:apiversion :   v1

    {{- end }}let's take a closer look at the  toppings:  list. the  range  function will
""range over"" (iterate through) the  pizzatoppings  list. but now something
interesting happens. just like  with  sets the scope of  . , so does a  range 
operator. each time through the loop,  .  is set to the current pizza topping.
that is, the first time,  .  is set to  mushrooms . the second iteration it is
set to  cheese , and so on.we can send the value of  .  directly down a pipeline, so when we do  {{ . | title | quote }} , it sends  .  to  title  (title case function) and then to
 quote . if we run this template, the output will be:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml

     - ""mushrooms""
     - ""cheese""
     - ""peppers""
     - ""onions""
     - ""pineapple""now, in this example we've done something tricky. the  toppings: |-  line is
declaring a multi-line string. so our list of toppings is actually not a yaml
list. it's a big string. why would we do this? because the data in configmaps
 data  is composed of key/value pairs, where both the key and the value are
simple strings. to understand why this is the case, take a look at the
 kubernetes configmap docs .
for us, though, this detail doesn't matter much.the  |-  marker in yaml takes a multi-line string. this can be a useful
technique for embedding big blocks of data inside of your manifests, as
exemplified here.sometimes it's useful to be able to quickly make a list inside of your template,
and then iterate over that list. helm templates have a function to make this
easy:  tuple . in computer science, a tuple is a list-like collection of fixed
size, but with arbitrary data types. this roughly conveys the way a  tuple  is
used.sizes :   |- 
     {{- range tuple ""small"" ""medium"" ""large"" }}
     - {{ . }}
     {{- end }}the above will produce this:sizes :   |- 
     - small
     - medium
     - largein addition to lists and tuples,  range  can be used to iterate over collections
that have a key and a value (like a  map  or  dict ). we'll see how to do that

```","3597, 3612, 3598","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**.

### Specific Issues:
1. **Global Context Access**: The ""rag answer"" uses `$.values.image.repository` to access the global context, which is correct. However, it does not consistently use the global context for the release name. Instead, it uses `$release.name`, which is not defined in the context of the loop. The correct way to access the release name in this context would be to use `$.Release.Name`.

2. **Node Name Usage**: The ""rag answer"" uses `{{ .name }}` for the StatefulSet name, which is not defined in the provided context. The reference answer correctly uses `{{ $.Release.Name }}` to ensure it accesses the global context for the release name.

3. **IP Address Variable**: The ""rag answer"" uses `{{ .ip }}` to access the IP address, which is acceptable if `.ip` is defined in the context of the nodes. However, the reference answer specifically uses `{{ .ip_address }}`, which may be more appropriate depending on the structure of the input data.

### Conclusion:
The ""rag answer"" has issues with accessing the global context correctly and may lead to errors when rendering the template. Therefore, it is incorrect."

### Explanation
Instead of creating the `Ingress` resource named `app-ingress` in the `ingress-nginx` namespace, you should create it in the same namespace where your service `api-sand` and the corresponding pod are located. Alternatively, you can achieve cross-namespace ingress by using the `ExternalName` service type. This allows you to reference a service in a different namespace. The example provided demonstrates how to set up an `ExternalName` service and an `Ingress` resource that routes traffic to it.","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressclassname: nginx-example
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /testpath
        pathtype: prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test
            port:
              number: 80

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

if you create it using

kubectl apply -f

you should be able to view the state of the ingress you added:

kubectl get ingress test-ingress

test-ingress   external-lb   *       203.0.113.123   80      59s

where

203.0.113.123

is the ip allocated by the ingress controller to satisfy this ingress.
note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.
an ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.
for example, a setup like:  figure.
ingress fan out it would require an ingress such as: service/networking/simple-fanout-example.yaml

  normal   add     22s                loadbalancer-controller  default/test

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.
 figure.
ingress name based virtual hosting the following ingress tells the backing load balancer to route requests based on the host header .
service/networking/name-virtual-host-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: name-virtual-host-ingress
spec:
  rules:

          service:
            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

second.bar.com

to service2, and any traffic whose request host header doesn't match

first.bar.com

and

second.bar.com

to service3.
service/networking/name-virtual-host-ingress-no-thi","ingresses can be implemented by different controllers, often with different configuration.
each ingress should specify a class, a reference to an ingressclass resource that contains additional configuration including the name of the controller that should implement the class.
service/networking/external-lb.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingressclass
metadata:
  name: external-lb
spec:
  controller: example.com/ingress-controller
  parameters:
    apigroup: k8s.example.com
    kind: ingressparameters
    name: external-lb

the

.spec.parameters

field of an ingressclass lets you reference another resource that provides configuration related to that ingressclass.
the specific type of parameters to use depends on the ingress controller that you specify in the

.spec.controller

field of the ingressclass.
ingressclass scope depending on your ingress controller, you may be able to use parameters that you set cluster-wide, or just for one namespace.
cluster  namespaced  the default scope for ingressclass parameters is cluster-wide.
if you set the

.spec.parameters

field and don't set

.spec.parameters.scope

, or if you set

.spec.parameters.scope

to cluster, then the ingressclass refers to a cluster-scoped resource.
the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a cluster-scoped api (possibly a custom resource), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific cluster scoped resource for that api.
for example:

---
apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingressclass
metadata:
  name: external-lb-1
spec:
  controller: example.com/ingress-controller
  parameters:
    # the parameters for this ingressclass are specified in a
    # clusteringressparameter (api group k8s.example.net) named
    # ""external-config-1"". this definition tells kubernetes to
    # look for a cluster-scoped parameter resource.
    scope: cluster
    apigroup: k8s.example.net
    kind: clusteringressparameter
    name: external-config-1

feature state:

kubernetes v1.23 [stable]

if you set the

.spec.parameters

field and set

.spec.parameters.scope

to namespace, then the ingressclass refers to a namespaced-scoped resource.
you must also set the namespace field within

.spec.parameters

to the namespace that contains the parameters you want to use.
the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a namespaced api (for example: configmap), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific resource in the namespace you specified in namespace.
namespace-scoped parameters help the cluster operator delegate control over the configuration (for example: load balancer settings, api gateway definition) that is used for a workload.
if you used a cluster-scoped parameter then either: the cluster operator team needs to approve a different team's changes every time there's a new configuration change being applied.
the cluster operator must define specific access controls, such as rbac  roles and bindings, that let the application team make changes to the cluster-scoped parameters resource.
the ingressclass api itself is always cluster-scoped.
here is an example of an ingressclass that refers to parameters that are namespaced:

---
apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingressclass
metadata:
  name: external-lb-2
spec:
  controller: example.com/ingress-controller
  parameters:
    # the parameters for this ingressclass are specified in an
    # ingressparameter (api group k8s.example.com) named ""external-config"",
    # that's in the ""external-configuration"" namespace.
    scope: namespace
    apigroup: k8s.example.com
    kind: ingressparameter
    namespace: external-configuration
    name: external-config

deprecated annotation before the ingressclass resource and ingressclassname field were added in kubernetes 1.18, ingress classes were specified with a

kubernetes.io/ingress.class

annotation on the ingress.
this annotation was never formally defined, but was widely supported by ingress controllers.
the newer ingressclassname field on ingresses is a replacement for that annotation, but is not a direct ","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

.spec.parameters.scope

to cluster, then the ingressclass refers to a cluster-scoped resource.
the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a cluster-scoped api (possibly a custom resource), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific cluster scoped resource for that api.
for example:

---
apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingressclass
metadata:
  name: external-lb-1
spec:
  controller: example.com/ingress-controller
  parameters:
    # the parameters for this ingressclass are specified in a
    # clusteringressparameter (api group k8s.example.net) named
    # ""external-config-1"". this definition tells kubernetes to
    # look for a cluster-scoped parameter resource.
    scope: cluster
    apigroup: k8s.example.net
    kind: clusteringressparameter
    name: external-config-1

feature state:

kubernetes v1.23 [stable]

if you set the

.spec.parameters

field and set

.spec.parameters.scope

to namespace, then the ingressclass refers to a namespaced-scoped resource.
you must also set the namespace field within

.spec.parameters

to the namespace that contains the parameters you want to use.
the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a namespaced api (for example: configmap), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific resource in the namespace you specified in namespace.
namespace-scoped parameters help the cluster operator delegate control over the configuration (for example: load balancer settings, api gateway definition) that is used for a workload.
if you used a cluster-scoped parameter then either: the cluster operator team needs to approve a different team's changes every time there's a new configuration change being applied.
the cluster operator must define specific access controls, such as rbac  roles and bindings, that let the application team make changes to the cluster-scoped parameters resource.
the ingressclass api itself is always cluster-scoped.
here is an example of an ingressclass that refers to parameters that are namespaced:

---
apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingressclass
metadata:
  name: external-lb-2
spec:
  controller: example.com/ingress-controller
  parameters:
    # the parameters for this ingressclass are specified in an
    # ingressparameter (api group k8s.example.com) named ""external-config"",
    # that's in the ""external-configuration"" namespace.
    scope: namespace
    apigroup: k8s.example.com
    kind: ingressparameter
    namespace: external-configuration
    name: external-config

deprecated annotation before the ingressclass resource and ingressclassname field were added in kubernetes 1.18, ingress classes were specified with a

kubernetes.io/ingress.class

annotation on the ingress.
this annotation was never formally defined, but was widely supported by ingress controllers.
the newer ingressclassname field on ingresses is a replacement for that annotation, but is not a direct ","```yaml

### Explanation:
- The issue arises because the Ingress resource is trying to reference a service (`api-sand`) in a different namespace (`resources`). Ingress resources can only route traffic to services within the same namespace unless you use a different method (like a cross-namespace service reference, which is not standard).
- The fix involves ensuring that the `api-sand` service is in the same namespace as the Ingress resource or adjusting the Ingress to point to a service in the `resources` namespace if cross-namespace routing is supported by your setup. However, standard Ingress does not support this directly.","```yaml

### Specific Issues:
1. **Namespace Mismatch**: The `rag answer` creates the `Ingress` resource in the `ingress-nginx` namespace while trying to reference the `api-sand` service, which is presumably in a different namespace (`resources`). This is a fundamental issue because, by default, an Ingress resource can only route traffic to services within the same namespace unless specific configurations or methods (like using an `ExternalName` service) are employed.

2. **Cross-Namespace Routing**: The explanation in the ""rag answer"" mentions that cross-namespace routing is not standard and suggests adjusting the Ingress to point to a service in the `resources` namespace. However, it does not provide a valid solution for cross-namespace routing, which is a critical aspect of the problem. The reference answer correctly suggests using an `ExternalName` service to achieve this.

3. **TLS Configuration**: The `rag answer` includes a TLS configuration for the Ingress, which is not addressed in the reference answer. While this is not inherently incorrect, it does not align with the context of the reference answer, which focuses on routing to an `ExternalName` service.

In summary, the ""rag answer"" fails to correctly address the namespace issue and does not provide a valid solution for cross-namespace service referencing, making it incorrect."
53429486,kubernetes - how to define configmap built using a file in a yaml?,"at present i am creating a configmap from the file config.json by executing:

kubectl create configmap jksconfig --from-file=config.json

# source: mychartv2/templates/jks-configmap.yaml

{{- range $key, $val := .values.json }}
      {{ $key | quote }}: {{ $val | quote }}
{{- end }}
    }
```

### Explanation
Your `config.json` file should be located within the `mychart/` directory, not inside `mychart/templates`. The `configmap.yaml` file defines a ConfigMap that includes the contents of `config.json`. The Helm command `helm install --dry-run --debug mychart` simulates the installation of the chart, allowing you to see the rendered output. 

If you want the values in the `config.json` file to be sourced from `values.yaml`, you can modify the `configmap.yaml` as shown above. In this configuration, the keys and values from the `values.yaml` file will be dynamically inserted into the `config.json` structure. For example, if your `values.yaml` contains:
```yaml
json:
  key1: val1
  key2: val2
  key3: val3
```
The resulting ConfigMap will include these values in the `config.json` file when rendered.","create a config map based on a file, directory, or specified literal value.

if the basename is an invalid key, you may specify an alternate key.
when creating a config map based on a directory, each file whose basename is a valid key in the directory will be packaged into the config map.
any directory entries except regular files are ignored (e.g.
subdirectories, symlinks, devices, pipes, etc).

========================================","you can use either

kubectl create configmap

or a configmap generator in

kustomization.yaml

to create a configmap.
create a configmap using

kubectl create configmap

use the

kubectl create configmap

command to create configmaps from directories , files , or literal values :

kubectl create configmap &lt;map-name&gt; &lt;data-source&gt;

where <map-name> is the name you want to assign to the configmap and <data-source> is the directory, file, or literal value to draw the data from.
the name of a configmap object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
when you are creating a configmap based on a file, the key in the <data-source> defaults to the basename of the file, and the value defaults to the file content.
you can use kubectl describe  or kubectl get  to retrieve information about a configmap.
create a configmap from a directory you can use

kubectl create configmap

to create a configmap from multiple files in the same directory.
when you are creating a configmap based on a directory, kubectl identifies files whose filename is a valid key in the directory and packages each of those files into the new configmap.
any directory entries except regular files are ignored (for example: subdirectories, symlinks, devices, pipes, and more).
note: each filename being used for configmap creation must consist of only acceptable characters, which are: letters (a to z and a to z), digits (0 to 9), '-', '_', or '.'.
if you use

kubectl create configmap

with a directory where any of the file names contains an unacceptable character, the kubectl command may fail.
the kubectl command does not print an error when it encounters an invalid filename.
create the local directory:

mkdir -p configure-pod-container/configmap/

now, download the sample configuration and create the configmap:

# download the sample files into `configure-pod-container/configmap/` directory
wget https://kubernetes.io/examples/configmap/game.properties -o configure-pod-container/configmap/game.properties
wget https://kubernetes.io/examples/configmap/ui.properties -o configure-pod-container/configmap/ui.properties

# create the configmap
kubectl create configmap game-config --from-file=configure-pod-container/configmap/

the above command packages each file, in this case,

game.properties

and

ui.properties

in the configure-pod-container/configmap/ directory into the game-config configmap.
you can display details of the configmap using the following command:

kubectl describe configmaps game-config

The ""reference answer"" demonstrates how to dynamically populate the `config.json` file with values from `values.yaml`, which is not addressed in the ""rag answer"".

3. **Indentation**: While the ""rag answer"" correctly mentions the use of `indent`, it does not provide the context of how the indentation fits into the overall structure of the ConfigMap, which is important for YAML formatting.

### Explanation
It appears that your JSON override is incorrectly specified. Unfortunately, the `kubectl run` command will simply ignore any fields it does not recognize. To troubleshoot this issue, I executed the command you provided and then, in a separate terminal, ran:

```bash
kubectl get job ubuntu -o json
```

This allowed me to observe that the actual job structure differs from your JSON override. Specifically, you were missing the nested `template/spec`, and the `volumes`, `volumeMounts`, and `containers` fields need to be defined as arrays.","an image volume for a pod is enabled by setting the

volumes.[*].image

field of

.spec

to a valid reference and consuming it in the volumemounts of the container.

    - name: volume
      mountpath: /volume
  volumes:
  - name: volume
    image:
      reference: quay.io/crio/artifact:v1
      pullpolicy: ifnotpresent

create the pod on your cluster:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/image-volumes.yaml

attach to the container:

kubectl attach -it image-volume bash

check the content of a file in the volume: cat /volume/dir/file the output is similar to: 1 you can also check another file in a different path: cat /volume/file the output is similar to: 2 ========================================","kubernetes supports many types of volumes.
a pod  can use any number of volume types simultaneously.
ephemeral volume  types have a lifetime of a pod, but persistent volumes  exist beyond the lifetime of a pod.
when a pod ceases to exist, kubernetes destroys ephemeral volumes; however, kubernetes does not destroy persistent volumes.
for any kind of volume in a given pod, data is preserved across container restarts.
at its core, a volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the containers in a pod.
how that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used.
to use a volume, specify the volumes to provide for the pod in

.spec.volumes

and declare where to mount those volumes into containers in

.spec.containers[*].volumemounts

.
when a pod is launched, a process in the container sees a filesystem view composed from the initial contents of the container image , plus volumes (if defined) mounted inside the container.
the process sees a root filesystem that initially matches the contents of the container image.
any writes to within that filesystem hierarchy, if allowed, affect what that process views when it performs a subsequent filesystem access.
volumes are mounted at specified paths  within the image.
for each container defined within a pod, you must independently specify where to mount each volume that the container uses.
volumes cannot mount within other volumes (but see using subpath  for a related mechanism).
also, a volume cannot contain a hard link to anything in a different volume.
========================================","for many steps here you will want to see what a pod running in the cluster sees.
the simplest way to do this is to run an interactive busybox pod:

kubectl run -it --rm --restart=never busybox --image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox sh

note: if you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
if you already have a running pod that you prefer to use, you can run a command in it using:

kubectl exec &lt;pod-name&gt; -c &lt;container-name&gt; -- &lt;command&gt;

========================================","an image volume for a pod is enabled by setting the

volumes.[*].image

field of

.spec

to a valid reference and consuming it in the volumemounts of the container.
for example: pods/image-volumes.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: image-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - name: shell
    command: [""sleep"", ""infinity""]
    image: debian
    volumemounts:
    - name: volume
      mountpath: /volume
  volumes:
  - name: volume
    image:
      reference: quay.io/crio/artifact:v1
      pullpolicy: ifnotpresent

create the pod on your cluster:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/image-volumes.yaml

attach to the container:

kubectl attach -it image-volume bash

check the content of a file in the volume: cat /volume/dir/file the output is similar to: 1 you can also check another file in a different path: cat /volume/file the output is similar to: 2 ======================================== kubernetes supports many types of volumes.
a pod  can use any number of volume types simultaneously.
ephemeral volume  types have a lifetime of a pod, but persistent volumes  exist beyond the lifetime of a pod.
when a pod ceases to exist, kubernetes destroys ephemeral volumes; however, kubernetes does not destroy persistent volumes.

### Specific Issues:
1. **Resource Type**: The ""rag answer"" defines a Pod (`kind: Pod`), while the ""reference answer"" is using `kubectl run` to create a Job. The context of the question seems to be about creating a Job, not just a Pod.

2. **Command Specification**: The ""rag answer"" uses `command: [""bash""]`, which is correct for running a command in a container, but it does not specify the interactive terminal options (`stdin: true` and `tty: true`) that are present in the ""reference answer"".

3. **Job Configuration**: The ""rag answer"" does not include the necessary structure for a Job, which is required if the intention is to create a Job as indicated in the ""reference answer"".

4. **Missing Parameters**: The ""rag answer"" lacks the `--restart=Never` parameter that is specified in the ""reference answer"", which is important for defining the restart policy for the Job.

In summary, the ""rag answer"" does not align with the requirements and structure needed to create a Job as described in the ""reference answer"", making it incorrect."
47021469,how to set google_application_credentials on gke running through kubernetes,"with the help of kubernetes i am running daily jobs on gke, on a daily basis based on cron configured in kubernetes a new container spins up and try to insert some data into bigquery.

the setup that we have is we have 2 different projects in gcp in one project we maintain the data in bigquery in other project we have all the gke running so when gke has to interact with different project resource my guess is i have to set an environment variable with name  google_application_credentials which points to a service account json file, but since every day kubernetes is spinning up a new container i am not sure how and where i should set this variable.

thanks in advance!

### Explanation
If your GKE project is named `my-gke` and the project containing the services that your GKE containers need to access is `my-data`, one way to set this up is as follows:

1. Create a service account in the `my-data` project and assign it the necessary GCP roles/permissions (for example, `roles/bigquery.dataviewer` if your GKE containers need to read from BigQuery tables).

2. Generate a service account key for that service account. When you do this in the Google Cloud Console, following the instructions at https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys, a JSON file containing the service account credentials will be automatically downloaded.

3. Create a Kubernetes Secret resource to store those service account credentials. The YAML snippet above illustrates how this might look.

4. Mount the credentials in the container that requires access. You can specify the volume and volume mount in your pod specification.

5. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in the container to point to the path of the mounted credentials file.

With this setup, any official GCP clients (such as the GCP Python client, GCP Java client, or the gcloud CLI) will recognize the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and use the credentials of the service account you created when making API requests.","you need to have a kubernetes cluster and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
the cluster is expected to have windows worker nodes.
this section covers a set of initial steps required once for each cluster: install the gmsacredentialspec crd a customresourcedefinition (crd) for gmsa credential spec resources needs to be configured on the cluster to define the custom resource type gmsacredentialspec.
download the gmsa crd yaml  and save it as gmsa-crd.yaml.
next, install the crd with

install webhooks to validate gmsa users two webhooks need to be configured on the kubernetes cluster to populate and validate gmsa credential spec references at the pod or container level: a mutating webhook that expands references to gmsas (by name from a pod specification) into the full credential spec in json form within the pod spec.
a validating webhook ensures all references to gmsas are authorized to be used by the pod service account.
installing the above webhooks and associated objects require the steps below: create a certificate key pair (that will be used to allow the webhook container to communicate to the cluster) install a secret with the certificate from above.
create a deployment for the core webhook logic.
create the validating and mutating webhook configurations referring to the deployment.
a script  can be used to deploy and configure the gmsa webhooks and associated objects mentioned above.
the script can be run with a --dry-run=server option to allow you to review the changes that would be made to your cluster.
the yaml template  used by the script may also be used to deploy the webhooks and associated objects manually (with appropriate substitutions for the parameters) ========================================","best practice:
use iam principal identifiers to configure workload identity federation for gke. however, this federated identity has specific limitations for each supported google cloud api. if these limitations apply to you, use the following steps to configure access to those apis from your gke workloads.

create a kubernetes namespace:



kubectl create namespace namespace
create a kubernetes serviceaccount:



kubectl create serviceaccount ksa_name \
    --namespace=namespace
create an iam service account. you can also use any existing iam service account in any project in your organization.



gcloud iam service-accounts create iam_sa_name \
    --project=iam_sa_project_id
replace the following:

iam_sa_name: a name for your new iam service account.
iam_sa_project_id: the project id for your iam service account.
for information on authorizing iam service accounts to access google cloud apis, see understanding service accounts.

grant your iam service account the roles that it needs on specific google cloud apis:



gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding iam_sa_project_id \
    --member ""serviceaccount:iam_sa_name@iam_sa_project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"" \
    --role ""role_name""
replace role_name with the name of the role, like roles/spanner.viewer.

create an iam allow policy that gives the kubernetes serviceaccount access to impersonate the iam service account:

    --role roles/iam.workloadidentityuser \
    --member ""serviceaccount:project_id.svc.id.goog[namespace/ksa_name]""
the member name must include the namespace and kubernetes serviceaccount name. for example, serviceaccount:example-project.svc.id.goog[example-namespace/example-serviceaccount].

```","1161, 3745, 3980","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**.

### Specific Issues:
1. **Resource Type**: The reference answer describes a Kubernetes `Secret`, while the rag answer describes a `CronJob`. These are fundamentally different Kubernetes resources serving different purposes. The reference answer is focused on storing service account credentials, while the rag answer is about scheduling jobs.

2. **Missing Secret Creation**: The rag answer does not include the creation of a Kubernetes Secret to store the service account credentials, which is a crucial step in the process outlined in the reference answer.

3. **Environment Variable for Credentials**: The rag answer does set an environment variable `google_application_credentials`, but it does not explain how the credentials are obtained or stored, nor does it show the creation of the Secret that would provide the credentials.

4. **Context and Purpose**: The reference answer is specifically about setting up GKE to access GCP services using a service account, while the rag answer appears to be a job configuration that does not directly relate to the setup of service account credentials.

In summary, the rag answer does not align with the requirements and context provided in the reference answer, making it incorrect in this scenario."

","The previous YAML configuration for deploying Tiller is correct and adheres to the requirements for Helm v2. However, it's important to note that Helm v3 has removed Tiller entirely, and the installation process has changed significantly. 

If you are using Helm v2, the provided YAML is appropriate for deploying Tiller in a Kubernetes cluster. However, if you are using Helm v3, you should not attempt to install Tiller, as it is no longer necessary. Instead, you can directly use Helm commands without Tiller.

For your specific error regarding ""the server could not find the requested resource,"" it may be due to the Kubernetes version you are using (1.16) and the compatibility with Helm v2. If you are still using Helm v2, ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is properly set up and that you have the necessary permissions and configurations in place.

If you are migrating to Helm v3, you should follow the new installation instructions without Tiller. Here’s a brief overview of how to install Helm v3:

1. **Install Helm v3**:
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
   ```

2. **Add a chart repository** (for example, the stable repository):
   ```bash
   helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable --force-update
   ```

3. **Install a chart**:
   ```bash
   helm install <release-name> <chart-name>
   ```

Make sure to replace `<release-name>` and `<chart-name>` with your desired values.

If you still need to use Helm v2 and Tiller, ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is compatible and that you have the correct service account and permissions set up for Tiller.","3621, 3712, 3527","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **correct** with some caveats. 

### Correct Aspects:
1. **Helm v2 vs. Helm v3**: The rag answer correctly identifies that Helm v3 has removed Tiller entirely, which is an important distinction when discussing Helm installations.
2. **Installation Instructions for Helm v3**: It provides accurate installation instructions for Helm v3, which is useful for users migrating from Helm v2.
3. **Error Explanation**: It mentions that the error regarding ""the server could not find the requested resource"" may be related to the Kubernetes version and Helm v2 compatibility, which is a valid point.

### Incorrect Aspects:
1. **YAML Configuration for Helm v2**: While it states that the YAML configuration for deploying Tiller is correct for Helm v2, it does not explicitly mention that the command in the reference answer is specifically tailored for a certain Kubernetes version and may require adjustments based on the cluster's configuration.
2. **Lack of Context**: The rag answer could provide more context on why the specific command in the reference answer is necessary, particularly the adjustments made for compatibility with the `apps/v1` API version.

### Conclusion:
Overall, the rag answer is correct in its understanding of the differences between Helm v2 and Helm v3, and it provides useful information for users. However, it could improve by offering more context regarding the specific YAML command from the reference answer."

For Kubernetes version 1.19.x, you should specify `batch/v1beta1` as the `apiVersion` for your CronJob. This is outlined in the documentation for version 1.19, which can be found at: https://v1-19.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/. The CronJob resource only reached stable status in Kubernetes version 1.21.","cronjob represents the configuration of a single cron job.

1. **apiVersion**: The ""rag answer"" uses `batch/v1beta1`, which is appropriate for Kubernetes version 1.19.x, matching the reference answer.
2. **kind**: Both answers correctly specify `CronJob`.
3. **metadata**: The name in the ""rag answer"" is different (`express-learn-cronjob` vs. `example-cronjob`), but this does not affect correctness.
4. **schedule**: The schedule in the ""rag answer"" is set to run every minute (`*/1 * * * *`), which is valid and functional, though it differs from the reference answer's schedule of every 5 minutes.
5. **jobTemplate**: The structure of the job template is correct, including the specification of containers and the restart policy.

Overall, while the ""rag answer"" has a different schedule and container name, it adheres to the required structure and specifications for a CronJob in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, making it a valid configuration."
30538210,how to mimic '--volumes-from' in kubernetes,"i'm looking for a pattern that allows to share volumes between two containers running on the same pod in kubernetes.

my use case is:
i have a ruby on rails application running inside a docker container.
the docker image contains static assets in /app/&lt;app-name&gt;/public directory, and i need to access those assets from the nginx container running alongside in the same pod.

in 'vanilla' docker i would have used --volumes-from flag to share this directory:

docker run --name app -v /app/&lt;app-dir&gt;/public &lt;app-image&gt;
docker run --volumes-from app nginx


after reading this doc: https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/volumes.md
i tried this (only relevant entries presented):

spec:
  containers:
    - image: &lt;app-image&gt;
      name: &lt;app-name&gt;
      volumemounts:
        - mountpath: /app/&lt;app-name&gt;/public
          name: assets
    - image: nginx
      name: nginx
      volumemounts:
        - mountpath: /var/www/html
          name: assets
          readonly: true
    volumes:
      - name: assets
        hostpath:
          path: /tmp/assets


but:


even though /tmp/assets on the node exists, it's empty
/app/&lt;app-name&gt;/public inside the app container is also empty


as a workaround i'm gonna try to populate the shared directory when the application container is up (simply cp /app/&lt;app-name&gt;/public/* to shared directory), but i really dislike this idea.

question: how to mimic --volumes-from in kubernetes, or if there is no direct counterpart, how can i share files from one container to other running in the same pod ?

### Explanation
In the latest Kubernetes release, you can utilize a feature called initContainers to manage the order of container initialization, which replaces the need for the postStart lifecycle hook mentioned in my previous response. The initContainer will ensure that the necessary files are copied before the main application container starts. 

Please note that initContainers are still considered a beta feature, and you can refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more details on handling initialization: [Kubernetes Init Containers](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/production-pods/#handling-initialization).","pods/storage/pv-duplicate.yaml

### Specific Issues:
1. **Pod Structure**: The ""rag answer"" does not include an `initContainer`, which is a key feature in the reference answer for managing the order of initialization. The reference answer uses an initContainer to copy necessary files before the main application container starts, which is not present in the rag answer.

2. **Container Configuration**: The ""rag answer"" uses placeholder values (`<app-name>` and `<app-image>`) instead of specific images and names, which makes it incomplete and not usable as is. The reference answer provides specific images and commands for the containers.

3. **Restart Policy**: The ""rag answer"" does not specify a `restartPolicy`, which is included in the reference answer. This is important for defining how the pod should behave in case of failures.

4. **Port Configuration**: The ""rag answer"" does not specify any ports for the containers, while the reference answer explicitly defines a port mapping for the Tomcat container.

5. **Volume Mounts**: The volume mount paths in the ""rag answer"" do not align with the purpose of the application as described in the reference answer. The reference answer clearly defines the purpose of the volume mounts related to the application being deployed.

In summary, the ""rag answer"" lacks critical components and specific configurations that are necessary for a functional Kubernetes Pod definition, making it incorrect compared to the reference answer."

### Explanation
I have reviewed your issue and reached the following conclusions: The ingress will function correctly, and the warnings you are encountering are merely notifications regarding the available API versioning. There is no need for concern about this. I have observed similar warnings:

```
@microk8s:~$ kubectl describe ing
warning: extensions/v1beta1 ingress is deprecated in v1.14+, unavailable in v1.22+; use networking.k8s.io/v1 ingress
```

Regarding the reason for these warnings appearing even when you specify `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1`, here’s the explanation: This behavior is expected. When you create an ingress object, it can be accessed through any version, as the server manages the conversion to the requested version. The command `kubectl get ingress` is ambiguous because it does not specify which version you want to retrieve. In such cases, `kubectl` consults the discovery documents provided by the server to find the first group/version that includes the specified resource.

Historically, for compatibility reasons, `extensions/v1beta1` has been favored over other API versions. Now that ingress is the only resource left in that group, and since it has a GA replacement, version 1.20 will lower its priority so that `kubectl get ingress` will read from `networking.k8s.io/v1`. However, a server running version 1.19 will still adhere to the historical priority.

If you wish to retrieve a specific version, you can qualify the get request (e.g., `kubectl get ingresses.v1.networking.k8s.io ...`) or provide a manifest file to request the same version specified in the file (e.g., `kubectl get -f ing.yaml -o yaml`).

In summary, even though you are using the correct `apiVersion`, the deprecated version is still treated as the default, which is why you are seeing the warning. Additionally, I have noticed that changes are still being made, indicating ongoing work in this area.","ingresses can be implemented by different controllers, often with different configuration.
each ingress should specify a class, a reference to an ingressclass resource that contains additional configuration including the name of the controller that should implement the class.

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1

  name: external-lb
spec:
  controller: example.com/ingress-controller
  parameters:
    apigroup: k8s.example.com
    kind: ingressparameters
    name: external-lb

the

.spec.parameters

field of an ingressclass lets you reference another resource that provides configuration related to that ingressclass.
the specific type of parameters to use depends on the ingress controller that you specify in the

.spec.controller

field of the ingressclass.
ingressclass scope depending on your ingress controller, you may be able to use parameters that you set cluster-wide, or just for one namespace.
cluster  namespaced  the default scope for ingressclass parameters is cluster-wide.
if you set the

.spec.parameters

field and don't set

.spec.parameters.scope

, or if you set

.spec.parameters.scope

to cluster, then the ingressclass refers to a cluster-scoped resource.
the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a cluster-scoped api (possibly a custom resource), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific cluster scoped resource for that api.

if you set the

.spec.parameters

field and set

.spec.parameters.scope

to namespace, then the ingressclass refers to a namespaced-scoped resource.
you must also set the namespace field within

.spec.parameters

to the namespace that contains the parameters you want to use.
the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a namespaced api (for example: configmap), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific resource in the namespace you specified in namespace.
namespace-scoped parameters help the cluster operator delegate control over the configuration (for example: load balancer settings, api gateway definition) that is used for a workload.
if you used a cluster-scoped parameter then either: the cluster operator team needs to approve a different team's changes every time there's a new configuration change being applied.
the cluster operator must define specific access controls, such as rbac  roles and bindings, that let the application team make changes to the cluster-scoped parameters resource.
the ingressclass api itself is always cluster-scoped.
here is an example of an ingressclass that refers to parameters that are namespaced:

---
apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingressclass
metadata:
  name: external-lb-2
spec:
  controller: example.com/ingress-controller
  parameters:
    # the parameters for this ingressclass are specified in an
    # ingressparameter (api group k8s.example.com) named ""external-config"",
    # that's in the ""external-configuration"" namespace.

    namespace: external-configuration

deprecated annotation before the ingressclass resource and ingressclassname field were added in kubernetes 1.18, ingress classes were specified with a

kubernetes.io/ingress.class

annotation on the ingress.
this annotation was never formally defined, but was widely supported by ingress controllers.
the newer ingressclassname field on ingresses is a replacement for that annotation, but is not a direct ","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

### Key Points:
- The `apiVersion` is correctly set to `networking.k8s.io/v1`, which is the appropriate version for Ingress resources as of Kubernetes v1.19 and later.
- The `pathType` is specified as `Prefix`, which is a valid option for defining how the path should be matched.
- The backend service configuration is correctly defined, pointing to the service named `cheddar` on port `80`.

This configuration should resolve the deprecation warnings you encountered regarding the use of `extensions/v1beta1` and `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`.","343, 341, 2147","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**. 

### Specific Issues:
1. **Service Name**: The ""rag answer"" uses the service name `cheddar`, while the ""reference answer"" uses `test`. This is not inherently incorrect, but it does not match the context of the original question or example provided in the ""reference answer"".

2. **Host Specification**: The ""rag answer"" includes a `host` field (`cheddar.213.215.191.78.nip.io`), which is not present in the ""reference answer"". While this is a valid addition, it changes the context of the Ingress resource and may not align with the original intent of the question.

3. **Path Definition**: The ""rag answer"" uses `path: /`, while the ""reference answer"" specifies `path: /testpath`. This is a significant change in the routing behavior of the Ingress resource.

4. **Explanation of Warnings**: The ""rag answer"" does not address the deprecation warnings or the behavior of `kubectl` commands as thoroughly as the ""reference answer"". It fails to explain why the warnings might still appear even when using the correct `apiVersion`.

### Conclusion:
While the ""rag answer"" contains valid YAML syntax and adheres to some specifications, it diverges from the context and details provided in the ""reference answer"". Therefore, it cannot be considered correct in the context of the original question."
52991038,how to create a servicemonitor for prometheus-operator?,"recently, prometheus-operator has been promoted to stable helm chart (https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator). 

i'd like to understand how to add a custom application to monitoring by prometheus-operator in a k8s cluster. an example for say gitlab runner which by default provides metrics on 9252 would be appreciated (https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/monitoring/#configuration-of-the-metrics-http-server).

i have a rudimentary yaml that obviously doesn't work but also not provides any feedback on what isn't working:

apiversion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: servicemonitor
metadata:
  name: gitlab-monitor
  # change this to the namespace the prometheus instance is running in
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: gitlab-runner-gitlab-runner
    release: prometheus
spec:
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: gitlab-runner-gitlab-runner
  namespaceselector:
    # matchnames:
    # - default
    any: true
  endpoints:
  - port: http-metrics
    interval: 15s


this is the prometheus configuration:

&gt; kubectl get prometheus -o yaml

...
servicemonitornamespaceselector: {}
servicemonitorselector:
  matchlabels:
    release: prometheus
...


so the selectors should match. by ""not working"" i mean that the endpoints do not appear in the prometheus ui.

### Explanation
I appreciate Peter for pointing out that the idea was fundamentally sound, which led me to discover the missing link. Since a ServiceMonitor is designed to monitor services, I overlooked the necessity of creating a service, which is not included in the GitLab Helm chart. Ultimately, this YAML configuration resolved the issue for me, and the metrics are now visible in Prometheus. 

It's worth noting that the target port for metrics is specified in the GitLab Runner chart.","to deploy a prometheus scraper to consistently scrape the metrics, use the following configuration:

for your amazon eks cluster, the core kubernetes control plane metrics are also ingested into amazon cloudwatch metrics under the aws/eks namespace.
to view them, open the cloudwatch console and select all metrics from the left navigation pane.
on the metrics selection page, choose the aws/eks namespace and a metrics dimension for your cluster.
========================================","in most cases metrics are available on /metrics endpoint of the http server.
for components that don't expose endpoint by default, it can be enabled using --bind-address flag.
examples of those components: kube-controller-manager  kube-proxy  kube-apiserver  kube-scheduler  kubelet  in a production environment you may want to configure prometheus server  or some other metrics scraper to periodically gather these metrics and make them available in some kind of time series database.
note that kubelet  also exposes metrics in /metrics/cadvisor, /metrics/resource and /metrics/probes endpoints.
those metrics do not have the same lifecycle.
if your cluster uses rbac , reading metrics requires authorization via a user, group or serviceaccount with a clusterrole that allows accessing /metrics.
for example:

  - nonresourceurls:
      - ""/metrics""
    verbs:
      - get

========================================","the first step in troubleshooting is triage.
what is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.
check the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:

kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}

look at the state of the containers in the pod.
are they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.
my pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.
generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.
look at the output of the

kubectl describe ...

command above.
there should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.
reasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
see compute resources document  for more information.
you are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.
in most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.
if you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.
my pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.
again, the information from

kubectl describe ...

should be informative.
the most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.
there are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
have you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.
for example, if you use docker on your pc, run

docker pull &lt;image&gt;

.
my pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.
this typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.
to identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.
if the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.
disable the webhook for update operations.
report an issue with the corresponding provider.
if you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.
for example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.
for a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.
in other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.
this allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.
my pod is crashing or otherwise unhealthy once your pod has been scheduled, the methods described in debug running pods  are available for debugging.
my pod is running but not doing what i told it to do if your pod is not behaving as you expected, it may be that there was an error in your pod description (e.g.

mypod.yaml

file on your local machine), and that the error was silently ignored when you created the pod.
often a section of the pod description is nested incorrectly, or a key name is typed incorrectly, and so the key is ignored.
for example, if you misspelled command as commnd then the pod will be created but will not use the command line you intended it to use.
the first thing to do is to delete your pod and try creating it again with the --validate option.
for example, run

kubectl apply --validate -f mypod.yaml

for your amazon eks cluster, the core kubernetes control plane metrics are also ingested into amazon cloudwatch metrics under the aws/eks namespace.
to view them, open the cloudwatch console and select all metrics from the left navigation pane.
on the metrics selection page, choose the aws/eks namespace and a metrics dimension for your cluster.
======================================== in most cases metrics are available on /metrics endpoint of the http server.
for components that don't expose endpoint by default, it can be enabled using --bind-address flag.
examples of those components: kube-controller-manager  kube-proxy  kube-apiserver  kube-scheduler  kubelet  in a production environment you may want to configure prometheus server  or some other metrics scraper to periodically gather these metrics and make them available in some kind of time series database.
note that kubelet  also exposes metrics in /metrics/cadvisor, /metrics/resource and /metrics/probes endpoints.
those metrics do not have the same lifecycle.
if your cluster uses rbac , reading metrics requires authorization via a user, group or serviceaccount with a clusterrole that allows accessing /metrics.
for example:

apiversion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: clusterrole
metadata:
  name: prometheus
rules:
  - nonresourceurls:
      - ""/metrics""
    verbs:
      - get

======================================== the first step in troubleshooting is triage.
what is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.
check the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:

kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}

look at the state of the containers in the pod.
are they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.
my pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.
generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.
look at the output of the

kubectl describe ...

command above.
there should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.
reasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
see compute resources document  for more information.
you are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.
in most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.
if you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.
my pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.
again, the information from

kubectl describe ...

should be informative.
the most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.
there are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
have you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.
for example, if you use docker on your pc, run

docker pull &lt;image&gt;

.
my pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.
this typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.
to identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.
if the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.
disable the webhook for update operations.
report an issue with the corresponding provider.
if you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.
for example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.
for a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.
in other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.
this allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.

1. **Service Definition**: The ""rag answer"" does not include a Service definition, which is essential for the ServiceMonitor to function correctly. The reference answer explicitly defines a Service that targets the GitLab instances, which is a critical component that the rag answer lacks.

2. **Port Name**: The ""rag answer"" specifies `http-metrics` as the port name in the endpoints section. However, the reference answer uses `metrics`, which is the correct port name defined in the GitLab chart. This discrepancy means that the ServiceMonitor in the rag answer would not be able to correctly scrape metrics from the intended service.

3. **Namespace Selector**: While the ""rag answer"" includes a `namespaceSelector` with `any: true`, this is not necessary if the ServiceMonitor is already defined in the same namespace as the service it is monitoring. The reference answer does not include this, which suggests a more straightforward approach.

In summary, the ""rag answer"" is incorrect due to the absence of a Service definition, incorrect port name, and unnecessary namespace selector."

i want to expose the microk8s dashboard within my local network to access it through http://main/dashboard/
to do so, i did the following nano ingress.yaml:

          serviceport: 443
        path: /

enabling the ingress-config through kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml gave the following error:
error: unable to recognize &quot;ingress.yaml&quot;: no matches for kind &quot;ingress&quot; in version &quot;extensions/v1beta1&quot;

help would be much appreciated, thanks!
update:
@harsh-manvar pointed out a mismatch in the config version. i have rewritten ingress.yaml to a very stripped down version:
apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: dashboard
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:

            name: kubernetes-dashboard
            port:
              number: 443

applying this works. also, the ingress rule gets created.

### Explanation
To resolve the error `error: unable to recognize ""ingress.yaml"": no matches for kind ""ingress"" in version ""extensions/v1beta1""`, you need to update the `apiVersion` to `networking.k8s.io/v1`. The `networkpolicy` resource in the `extensions/v1beta1` API version is no longer supported, and you should migrate to the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API version, which has been available since v1.8. Existing persisted data can still be accessed and modified using the new version.

For the second issue, you need to make several adjustments to your Ingress definition to ensure the Kubernetes dashboard is properly exposed on the MicroK8s cluster:

1. Add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2`.
2. Include the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | rewrite ^(/dashboard)$ $1/ redirect;`.
3. Change the path from `path: /dashboard` to `path: /dashboard(/|$)(.*)`.

These changes are necessary to correctly forward requests to the backend pods. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation modifies the URL before it reaches the backend pods. In the path `/dashboard(/|$)(.*)`, the `(.*)` captures the dynamic URL generated when accessing the Kubernetes dashboard. The rewrite target annotation replaces this captured data in the URL before sending the request to the `kubernetes-dashboard` service. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` annotation ensures that a trailing slash (`/`) is added only when accessing `alb-url/dashboard`.

Additionally, you need to make two more changes:

1. Add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""https""` to instruct the NGINX Ingress to communicate with the dashboard service over HTTPS.
2. Include the annotation `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: public` to specify the use of the NGINX Ingress created by the MicroK8s Ingress plugin.

After implementing all the above changes, the final YAML configuration should work correctly without needing to run the MicroK8s proxy command.","ingress backed by a single service there are existing kubernetes concepts that allow you to expose a single service (see alternatives ).
you can also do this with an ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.
service/networking/test-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
spec:
  defaultbackend:
    service:
      name: test
      port:
        number: 80

if you create it using

kubectl apply -f

you should be able to view the state of the ingress you added:

kubectl get ingress test-ingress



name           class         hosts   address         ports   age
test-ingress   external-lb   *       203.0.113.123   80      59s

where

203.0.113.123

is the ip allocated by the ingress controller to satisfy this ingress.
note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.
an ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.
for example, a setup like:  figure.
ingress fan out it would require an ingress such as: service/networking/simple-fanout-example.yaml

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.
 figure.
ingress name based virtual hosting the following ingress tells the backing load balancer to route requests based on the host header .

            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

second.bar.com

to service2, and any traffic whose request host header doesn't match

first.bar.com

and

second.bar.com

to service3.

verify the ip address is set:

kubectl get ingress

note: this can take a couple of minutes.
you should see an ipv4 address in the address column; for example:

verify that the ingress controller is directing traffic, by following the instructions for your platform: note: the network is limited if using the docker driver on macos (darwin) and the node ip is not reachable directly.
to get ingress to work you’ll need to open a new terminal and run minikube tunnel.
sudo permission is required for it, so provide the password when prompted.

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

                ","ingress backed by a single service there are existing kubernetes concepts that allow you to expose a single service (see alternatives ).
you can also do this with an ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.

metadata:
  name: test-ingress
spec:
  defaultbackend:
    service:
      name: test

        number: 80

if you create it using

kubectl apply -f

you should be able to view the state of the ingress you added:

kubectl get ingress test-ingress



name           class         hosts   address         ports   age
test-ingress   external-lb   *       203.0.113.123   80      59s

where

203.0.113.123

is the ip allocated by the ingress controller to satisfy this ingress.
note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.
an ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.
for example, a setup like:  figure.
ingress fan out it would require an ingress such as: service/networking/simple-fanout-example.yaml

1. **Missing Annotations**: 
   - The ""rag answer"" does not include the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2`, which is necessary for URL rewriting.
   - It also lacks the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | rewrite ^(/dashboard)$ $1/ redirect;`, which is important for handling trailing slashes correctly.
   - The annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""https""` is missing, which is required to specify that the backend service should be accessed over HTTPS.

2. **Path Definition**: 
   - The path in the ""rag answer"" is defined as `path: /dashboard`, whereas the ""reference answer"" uses `path: /dashboard(/|$)(.*)`. The latter allows for capturing additional path segments after `/dashboard`, which is necessary for proper request forwarding to the backend service.

3. **Ingress Class**: 
   - The ""rag answer"" specifies `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx`, while the ""reference answer"" uses `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: public`. This may lead to issues if the Ingress controller is expecting a different class.

In summary, the ""rag answer"" is missing critical annotations and has an incorrect path definition, making it incorrect compared to the ""reference answer."""

I would like to point out that, according to the Kubernetes deprecation guide, the `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API version of Ingress is no longer supported as of v1.22. The changes include:

- The `backend` `servicename` field has been renamed to `service.name`.
- Numeric `backend` `serviceport` fields have been renamed to `service.port.number`.
- String `backend` `serviceport` fields have been renamed to `service.port.name`.
- The `pathType` is now required for each specified path, with options being `Prefix`, `Exact`, and `ImplementationSpecific`.

This means we need to make the following modifications to transition from the previous version:","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressclassname: nginx-example
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /testpath
        pathtype: prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: test
            port:
              number: 80

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

                ","ingress backed by a single service there are existing kubernetes concepts that allow you to expose a single service (see alternatives ).
you can also do this with an ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
spec:
  defaultbackend:
    service:
      name: test
      port:
        number: 80

if you create it using

kubectl apply -f

you should be able to view the state of the ingress you added:

kubectl get ingress test-ingress



name           class         hosts   address         ports   age
test-ingress   external-lb   *       203.0.113.123   80      59s

where

203.0.113.123

is the ip allocated by the ingress controller to satisfy this ingress.
note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.
an ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.
for example, a setup like:  figure.
ingress fan out it would require an ingress such as: service/networking/simple-fanout-example.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: simple-fanout-example

  normal   add     22s                loadbalancer-controller  default/test

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.
 figure.
ingress name based virtual hosting the following ingress tells the backing load balancer to route requests based on the host header .
service/networking/name-virtual-host-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: name-virtual-host-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:

          service:
            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

second.bar.com

to service2, and any traffic whose request host header doesn't match

first.bar.com

and

second.bar.com

to service3.

```

### Explanation
It is common to implement basic authentication for securing access. According to Kubernetes documentation, you can protect access to Traefik by following these steps:

1. Create an authentication file using the `htpasswd` tool. You will be prompted to enter a password for the user:
   ```bash
   htpasswd -c ./auth
   ```

2. Use `kubectl` to create a secret in the `monitoring` namespace with the file generated by `htpasswd`:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic mysecret --from-file=auth --namespace=monitoring
   ```

3. Enable basic authentication by adding annotations to the Ingress object:
   - `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: ""basic""`
   - `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: ""mysecret""`

The complete configuration for basic authentication would look like the YAML provided above. You can apply this configuration using the following command:
```bash

before exposing the service to the internet, you want to make sure the communication channel is secure.
for this, you will need: self signed certificates for https (unless you already have an identity certificate) an nginx server configured to use the certificates a secret  that makes the certificates accessible to pods you can acquire all these from the nginx https example .
this requires having go and make tools installed.
if you don't want to install those, then follow the manual steps later.

This YAML configuration is correct for setting up basic authentication with Traefik as the ingress controller. Ensure that the secret ""mypasswd"" is properly created in Kubernetes and contains the necessary credentials for basic authentication.","3391, 1882, 3395","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**. 

Here are the specific points of comparison:

1. **Annotations**: 
   - The reference answer uses annotations `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type` and `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret`, which are standard for basic authentication with Traefik. 
   - The rag answer uses `traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type` and `traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret`, which are not the correct annotations for Traefik. The correct annotations should be prefixed with `kubernetes.io` as shown in the reference answer.

2. **Secret Name**: 
   - The reference answer uses the secret name `mysecret`, while the rag answer uses `mypasswd`. This inconsistency means that if the secret `mypasswd` is not created, the authentication will fail.

3. **Service Name and Port**: 
   - The reference answer specifies a service named `prometheus` on port `9090`, while the rag answer specifies a service named `nginxservice` on port `80`. While this may be valid in a different context, it does not align with the reference answer's context of securing the Prometheus dashboard.

4. **Host**: 
   - The rag answer uses `nginx.mycompany.com` as the host, which is different from the reference answer's `dashboard.prometheus.example.com`. This is not inherently incorrect, but it does not match the context of the reference answer.

In summary, the rag answer has incorrect annotations and a different secret name, which are critical for the proper functioning of basic authentication with Traefik. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct."
48023475,add random string on kubernetes pod deployment name,"i have a template that is basically an utility container for running kubectl inside a pod.

what i want to do, is to be able to have multiple deployments of that same template, with different names, as in ""utilitypod-randomid"".

is there a way to do that, via kubectl and some shell scripting, or something similar?

the current template looks like this:

### Explanation
You can use `generateName` instead of `name`, which appends a random suffix to the specified base name. This will modify your template accordingly. However, it's important to note that this approach will only work with the command `kubectl create -f template.yaml`. The `apply` command looks for a resource by its name and attempts to compare definitions, but since this template does not specify a concrete name, it won't function with `apply`.","often times configmaps or secrets are injected as configuration files in
containers or there are other external dependency changes that require rolling
pods. depending on the application a restart may be required should those be
updated with a subsequent  helm upgrade , but if the deployment spec itself
didn't change the application keeps running with the old configuration resulting
in an inconsistent deployment.the  sha256sum  function can be used to ensure a deployment's annotation section
is updated if another file changes:kind :   deployment 
 spec : 
    template : 
      metadata : 
        annotations : 
          checksum/config :   {{   include (print $.template.basepath ""/configmap.yaml"") . | sha256sum }} 
 [...]note: if you're adding this to a library chart you won't be able to access your
file in  $.template.basepath . instead you can reference your definition with
 {{ include (""mylibchart.configmap"") . | sha256sum }} .in the event you always want to roll your deployment, you can use a similar
annotation step as above, instead replacing with a random string so it always
changes and causes the deployment to roll:kind :   deployment 
 spec : 
    template : 
      metadata : 
        annotations : 
          rollme :   {{   randalphanum 5 | quote }} 
 [...]each invocation of the template function will generate a unique random string.
this means that if it's necessary to sync the random strings used by multiple
resources, all relevant resources will need to be in the same template file.both of these methods allow your deployment to leverage the built in update
strategy logic to avoid taking downtime.note: in the past we recommended using the  --recreate-pods  flag as another
option. this flag has been marked as deprecated in helm 3 in favor of the more
declarative method above.","kustomize is a tool for customizing kubernetes configurations.
it has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.
the source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:
  - .env
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file

### Specific Issues:
1. **Use of `name` instead of `generateName`:** 
   - The reference answer correctly uses `generateName`, which allows Kubernetes to append a random suffix to the base name when creating the pod. The rag answer attempts to use a templating function to generate a random string for the `name` field, which is not a standard Kubernetes feature. Kubernetes does not support templating functions like `{{ randalphanum 5 | quote }}` in the manifest files directly.

2. **Incorrect Resource Kind Capitalization:**
   - The rag answer uses `kind: pod` with a lowercase 'p'. In Kubernetes YAML manifests, the kind should be capitalized as `kind: Pod`.

3. **Explanation of Random Name Generation:**
   - The rag answer states that it uses a random string in the pod name to allow for multiple deployments of the same template. However, this is not a valid approach in Kubernetes as mentioned above. The correct way to achieve this is through `generateName`.

### Conclusion:
The rag answer does not adhere to Kubernetes specifications and contains errors in both the naming convention and the method of generating unique names. Therefore, it is incorrect."

note: when adding a raw block device for a pod, you specify the device path in the container instead of a mount path.
binding block volumes if a user requests a raw block volume by indicating this using the volumemode field in the persistentvolumeclaim spec, the binding rules differ slightly from previous releases that didn't consider this mode as part of the spec.
listed is a table of possible combinations the user and admin might specify for requesting a raw block device.
the table indicates if the volume will be bound or not given the combinations: volume binding matrix for statically provisioned volumes: pv volumemode pvc volumemode result unspecified unspecified bind unspecified block no bind unspecified filesystem bind block unspecified no bind block block bind block filesystem no bind filesystem filesystem bind filesystem block no bind filesystem unspecified bind note: only statically provisioned volumes are supported for alpha release.
administrators should take care to consider these values when working with raw block devices.
======================================== storageclasses have parameters that describe volumes belonging to the storage class.
different parameters may be accepted depending on the provisioner.
when a parameter is omitted, some default is used.
there can be at most 512 parameters defined for a storageclass.
the total length of the parameters object including its keys and values cannot exceed 256 kib.
aws ebs kubernetes 1.32 does not include a awselasticblockstore volume type.
the awselasticblockstore in-tree storage driver was deprecated in the kubernetes v1.19 release and then removed entirely in the v1.27 release.
the kubernetes project suggests that you use the aws ebs  out-of-tree storage driver instead.
here is an example storageclass for the aws ebs csi driver: storage/storageclass/storageclass-aws-ebs.yaml

filesystemid: the file system under which the access point is created.
directoryperms: the directory permissions of the root directory created by the access point.
for more details, refer to the aws_efs_csi_driver dynamic provisioning  documentation.
nfs to configure nfs storage, you can use the in-tree driver or the nfs csi driver for kubernetes  (recommended).

### Specific Issues:
1. **Resource Type**: The ""rag answer"" defines a `PersistentVolume` (PV) instead of a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC). The reference answer correctly specifies a PVC, which is the appropriate resource to request storage from a provisioner.

2. **Provisioning Context**: The reference answer explains that when using a provisioner, you typically create a PVC, and the system automatically provisions the PV. The ""rag answer"" manually defines a PV, which contradicts the context of using a provisioner.

3. **Field Names**: The ""rag answer"" uses lowercase for `kind: persistentvolume`, which should be `kind: PersistentVolume` to follow Kubernetes naming conventions.

4. **GCE Persistent Disk Specification**: The ""rag answer"" includes a `gcePersistentDisk` section, which is not necessary when using a dynamic provisioner. The reference answer implies that the PV will be created automatically, and specifying a disk name is not required in that context.

In summary, the ""rag answer"" does not align with the correct approach of using a PVC for dynamic provisioning in Kubernetes, making it incorrect."
59258223,how to resolve pod hostnames from other pods?,"
i have 2 pods running on 2 nodes, each pod runs in different node.
these nodes are on the same subnet and can tcp/udp/icmp themselves.


these pods got some hostnames, ie:


drill-staging-75cddd789-kbzsq
drill-staging-75cddd789-amsrj


from pod drill-staging-75cddd789-kbzsq i cannot resolve host name for drill-staging-75cddd789-amsrj and vice versa. resolving self pod's name works.

i tried setting various dnspolicies:


clusterfirst: no luck
default: no luck
clusterfirstwithhostnet: no luck and it event couldn't resolve hostname of it's own node
none: not tried (i don't think it's a good way)

### Explanation
Typically, DNS names are assigned to services rather than pods, meaning that by default, you cannot reference another pod directly using a domain name; you can only use its IP address. However, pods can receive DNS names under specific conditions, which include the presence of a headless service, as detailed in the documentation. The requirements are as follows:

- The pods must have a `hostname` field.
- The pods must have a `subdomain` field.
- There must be a headless service (within the same namespace) that selects the pods.
- The name of the headless service must match the `subdomain` field of the pods.

When these conditions are met, each pod is assigned a fully-qualified domain name in the format:

`my-hostname.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local`

Here, `my-hostname` corresponds to the `hostname` field of the pod, and `my-subdomain` corresponds to the `subdomain` field of the pod. 

**Note:** The DNS name is generated based on the pod's `hostname`, not its `name`.

You can verify this setup by executing the following commands after applying the configuration:

```bash
kubectl exec -ti my-pod-1 bash
```

From within one of the pods, you should be able to resolve the fully-qualified domain names of both pods:

```bash
host my-hostname-1.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local
host my-hostname-2.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local
```

Since the requests are made from the same namespace as the target pods, you can simplify the domain names to:

```bash
host my-hostname-1.my-subdomain
host my-hostname-2.my-subdomain
```","a/aaaa records kube-dns versions, prior to the implementation of the dns specification , had the following dns resolution:

pod-ipv4-address.my-namespace.pod.cluster-domain.example

.
for example, if a pod in the default namespace has the ip address 172.17.0.3, and the domain name for your cluster is

cluster.local

, then the pod has a dns name:

172-17-0-3.default.pod.cluster.local

.
any pods exposed by a service have the following dns resolution available:

pod-ipv4-address.service-name.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

.
pod's hostname and subdomain fields currently when a pod is created, its hostname (as observed from within the pod) is the pod's

metadata.name

value.
the pod spec has an optional hostname field, which can be used to specify a different hostname.
when specified, it takes precedence over the pod's name to be the hostname of the pod (again, as observed from within the pod).
for example, given a pod with

spec.hostname

set to ""my-host"", the pod will have its hostname set to ""my-host"".
the pod spec also has an optional subdomain field which can be used to indicate that the pod is part of sub-group of the namespace.
for example, a pod with

spec.hostname

set to ""foo"", and

spec.subdomain

set to ""bar"", in namespace ""my-namespace"", will have its hostname set to ""foo"" and its fully qualified domain name (fqdn) set to

""foo.bar.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local""

(once more, as observed from within the pod).
if there exists a headless service in the same namespace as the pod, with the same name as the subdomain, the cluster's dns server also returns a and/or aaaa records for the pod's fully qualified hostname.
example:

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: busybox-subdomain
spec:
  selector:
    name: busybox
  clusterip: none
  ports:
  - name: foo # name is not required for single-port services
    port: 1234
---
apiversion: v1

  containers:
  - image: busybox:1.28
    command:
      - sleep
      - ""3600""
    name: busybox

given the above service ""busybox-subdomain"" and the pods which set

spec.subdomain

to ""busybox-subdomain"", the first pod will see its own fqdn as

""busybox-1.busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example""

.
dns serves a and/or aaaa records at that name, pointing to the pod's ip.
both pods ""busybox1"" and ""busybox2"" will have their own address records.
an endpointslice  can specify the dns hostname for any endpoint addresses, along with its ip.
note: a and aaaa records are not created for pod names since hostname is missing for the pod.
a pod with no hostname but with subdomain will only create the a or aaaa record for the headless service (

busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

), pointing to the pods' ip addresses.
also, the pod needs to be ready in order to have a record unless publishnotreadyaddresses=true is set on the service.
pod's sethostnameasfqdn field feature state:

kubernetes v1.22 [stable]

when a pod is configured to have fully qualified domain name (fqdn), its hostname is the short hostname.
for example, if you have a pod with the fully qualified domain name

busybox-1.busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

, then by default the hostname command inside that pod returns busybox-1 and the hostname --fqdn command returns the fqdn.
when you set sethostnameasfqdn: true in the pod spec, the kubelet writes the pod's fqdn into the hostname for that pod's namespace.
in this case, both hostname and hostname --fqdn return the pod's fqdn.
note: in linux, the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname) is limited to 64 characters.
if a pod enables this feature and its fqdn is longer than 64 character, it will fail to start.
the po","to enable pod-to-pod communication using pod hostnames in a job, you must do the following: set up a headless service  with a valid label selector for the pods created by your job.
the headless service must be in the same namespace as the job.
one easy way to do this is to use the job-name: <your-job-name> selector, since the job-name label will be automatically added by kubernetes.
this configuration will trigger the dns system to create records of the hostnames of the pods running your job.
configure the headless service as subdomain service for the job pods by including the following value in your job template spec: subdomain: <headless-svc-name> example below is a working example of a job with pod-to-pod communication via pod hostnames enabled.
the job is completed only after all pods successfully ping each other using hostnames.
note: in the bash script executed on each pod in the example below, the pod hostnames can be prefixed by the namespace as well if the pod needs to be reached from outside the namespace.

              ping -c 1 example-job-${i}.headless-svc &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
              gotstatus=$?                
              if [ $gotstatus -ne $wantstatus ]; then
                echo ""failed to ping pod example-job-${i}.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...""

            echo ""successfully pinged pod: example-job-${i}.headless-svc""
          done

after applying the example above, reach each other over the network using:

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

.
you should see output similar to the following:

kubectl logs example-job-0-qws42



failed to ping pod example-job-0.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...
successfully pinged pod: example-job-0.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-1.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-2.headless-svc

note: keep in mind that the

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

name format used in this example would not work with dns policy set to none or default.
you can learn more about pod dns policies here .
========================================","clusterfirstwithhostnet is not supported for pods that run on windows nodes.
windows treats all names with a

.

as a fqdn and skips fqdn resolution.
on windows, there are multiple dns resolvers that can be used.
as these come with slightly different behaviors, using the resolve-dnsname  powershell cmdlet for name query resolutions is recommended.
on linux, you have a dns suffix list, which is used after resolution of a name as fully qualified has failed.
on windows, you can only have 1 dns suffix, which is the dns suffix associated with that pod's namespace (example:

mydns.svc.cluster.local

).
windows can resolve fqdns, services, or network name which can be resolved with this single suffix.
for example, a pod spawned in the default namespace, will have the dns suffix

default.svc.cluster.local

.

kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local

and kubernetes, but not the partially qualified names (

the po to enable pod-to-pod communication using pod hostnames in a job, you must do the following: set up a headless service  with a valid label selector for the pods created by your job.
the headless service must be in the same namespace as the job.
one easy way to do this is to use the job-name: <your-job-name> selector, since the job-name label will be automatically added by kubernetes.
this configuration will trigger the dns system to create records of the hostnames of the pods running your job.
configure the headless service as subdomain service for the job pods by including the following value in your job template spec: subdomain: <headless-svc-name> example below is a working example of a job with pod-to-pod communication via pod hostnames enabled.
the job is completed only after all pods successfully ping each other using hostnames.
note: in the bash script executed on each pod in the example below, the pod hostnames can be prefixed by the namespace as well if the pod needs to be reached from outside the namespace.

            do                                       
              ping -c 1 example-job-${i}.headless-svc &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
              gotstatus=$?                
              if [ $gotstatus -ne $wantstatus ]; then
                echo ""failed to ping pod example-job-${i}.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...""

            echo ""successfully pinged pod: example-job-${i}.headless-svc""
          done

after applying the example above, reach each other over the network using:

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

.
you should see output similar to the following:

kubectl logs example-job-0-qws42



failed to ping pod example-job-0.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...
successfully pinged pod: example-job-0.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-1.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-2.headless-svc

note: keep in mind that the

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

name format used in this example would not work with dns policy set to none or default.
you can learn more about pod dns policies here .
======================================== clusterfirstwithhostnet is not supported for pods that run on windows nodes.
windows treats all names with a

.

as a fqdn and skips fqdn resolution.
on windows, there are multiple dns resolvers that can be used.
as these come with slightly different behaviors, using the resolve-dnsname  powershell cmdlet for name query resolutions is recommended.
on linux, you have a dns suffix list, which is used after resolution of a name as fully qualified has failed.
on windows, you can only have 1 dns suffix, which is the dns suffix associated with that pod's namespace (example:

mydns.svc.cluster.local

).
windows can resolve fqdns, services, or network name which can be resolved with this single suffix.
for example, a pod spawned in the default namespace, will have the dns suffix

default.svc.cluster.local

.
inside a windows pod, you can resolve both

kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local

and kubernetes, but not the partially qualified names (

kubernetes.default

or

kubernetes.default.svc

).

Here’s a brief explanation of the configuration:

1. **Headless Service**: The service is defined with `clusterIP: None`, which creates a headless service. This allows DNS records to be created for each pod, enabling them to resolve each other's hostnames.

2. **Subdomain**: The `subdomain` field in the pod spec is set to match the headless service name (`drill-staging`). This means that each pod will have a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that can be used to communicate with each other.

3. **Deployment**: The deployment is configured to have two replicas, ensuring that there are two pods running, each of which can resolve the other's hostname.

The configuration is already clear and correctly formatted, so no further changes are necessary.","376, 1586, 378","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**. 

Here are the specific points of error:

1. **Incorrect Service Name**: The rag answer mentions that the `subdomain` field in the pod spec is set to match the headless service name (`drill-staging`). However, in the reference answer, the headless service is named `my-subdomain`, not `drill-staging`. This discrepancy indicates a misunderstanding of the configuration.

2. **Deployment Mention**: The rag answer refers to a ""deployment"" with two replicas, but the reference answer does not mention a deployment; it directly defines two pods. This could lead to confusion, as the context of a deployment is not present in the reference answer.

3. **Lack of Clarity on FQDN**: While the rag answer correctly states that the headless service allows pods to resolve each other's hostnames, it does not explicitly mention the format of the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) as provided in the reference answer. This omission could lead to a lack of understanding of how the DNS resolution works in this context.

In summary, the rag answer contains inaccuracies regarding the service name and the context of the configuration, making it incorrect."

and with the error code 127:

from what i checked, the error code 127 says that the command doesn't exist. how could i run the kubectl command then as a cron job ? am i missing something?

note: i had posted a similar question ( scheduled restart of kubernetes pod without downtime ) , but that was more of having the main deployment itself as a cronjob, here i'm trying to run a kubectl command (which does the restart) using a cronjob - so i thought it would be better to post separately

### Explanation
In summary, the BusyBox image does not come with `kubectl` pre-installed. You can verify this by running the command `kubectl run -i --tty busybox --image=busybox -- sh`, which will start a BusyBox pod with an interactive shell. I recommend using the `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image instead. Additionally, ensure that you have the appropriate RBAC permissions set up, as you may encounter a ""forbidden"" error when trying to access services. The provided YAML configuration includes a Role and RoleBinding to grant the necessary permissions, along with a ServiceAccount and a CronJob that utilizes the `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image to patch a deployment in the specified namespace.","cron jobs require a config file.
here is a manifest for a cronjob that runs a simple demonstration task every minute: application/job/cronjob.yaml

            - -c
            - date; echo hello from the kubernetes cluster
          restartpolicy: onfailure

run the example cronjob by using this command:

kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/job/cronjob.yaml

the output is similar to this:

cronjob.batch/hello created

after creating the cron job, get its status using this command:

kubectl get cronjob hello

the output is similar to this:

name    schedule      suspend   active   last schedule   age
hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        &lt;none&gt;          10s

as you can see from the results of the command, the cron job has not scheduled or run any jobs yet.
watch  for the job to be created in around one minute:

kubectl get jobs --watch

the output is similar to this:

name               completions   duration   age
hello-4111706356   0/1                      0s
hello-4111706356   0/1           0s         0s
hello-4111706356   1/1           5s         5s

now you've seen one running job scheduled by the ""hello"" cron job.
you can stop watching the job and view the cron job again to see that it scheduled the job:

kubectl get cronjob hello

the output is similar to this:

name    schedule      suspend   active   last schedule   age
hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        50s             75s

you should see that the cron job hello successfully scheduled a job at the time specified in last schedule.
there are currently 0 active jobs, meaning that the job has completed or failed.
now, find the pods that the last scheduled job created and view the standard output of one of the pods.
note: the job name is different from the pod name.

# replace ""hello-4111706356"" with the job name in your system
pods=$(kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=hello-4111706356 --output=jsonpath={.items[*].metadata.name})

show the pod log:

kubectl logs $pods

the output is similar to this:

========================================","unsupported timezone specification specifying a timezone using cron_tz or tz variables inside

.spec.schedule

is not officially supported (and never has been).
starting with kubernetes 1.29 if you try to set a schedule that includes tz or cron_tz timezone specification, kubernetes will fail to create the resource with a validation error.
updates to cronjobs already using tz or cron_tz will continue to report a warning  to the client.
modifying a cronjob by design, a cronjob contains a template for new jobs.
if you modify an existing cronjob, the changes you make will apply to new jobs that start to run after your modification is complete.
jobs (and their pods) that have already started continue to run without changes.
that is, the cronjob does not update existing jobs, even if those remain running.
job creation a cronjob creates a job object approximately once per execution time of its schedule.
the scheduling is approximate because there are certain circumstances where two jobs might be created, or no job might be created.
kubernetes tries to avoid those situations, but does not completely prevent them.
therefore, the jobs that you define should be idempotent .
starting with kubernetes v1.32, cronjobs apply an annotation

batch.kubernetes.io/cronjob-scheduled-timestamp

to their created jobs.
this annotation indicates the originally scheduled creation time for the job and is formatted in rfc3339.
if startingdeadlineseconds is set to a large value or left unset (the default) and if concurrencypolicy is set to allow, the jobs will always run at least once.
caution: if startingdeadlineseconds is set to a value less than 10 seconds, the cronjob may not be scheduled.
this is because the cronjob controller checks things every 10 seconds.
for every cronjob, the cronjob controller  checks how many schedules it missed in the duration from its last scheduled time until now.
if there are more than 100 missed schedules, then it does not start the job and logs the error.

cannot determine if job needs to be started. too many missed start time (&gt; 100). set or decrease .spec.startingdeadlineseconds or check clock skew.

it is important to note that if the startingdeadlineseconds field is set (not nil), the controller counts how many missed jobs occurred from the value of startingdeadlineseconds until now rather than from the last scheduled time until now.
for example, if startingdeadlineseconds is 200, the controller counts how many missed jobs occurred in the last 200 seconds.
a cronjob is counted as missed if it has failed to be created at its scheduled time.
for example, if concurrencypolicy is set to forbid and a cronjob was attempted to be scheduled when there was a previous schedule still running, then it would count as missed.
for example, suppose a cronjob is set to schedule a new job every one minute beginning at 08:30:00, and its startingdeadlineseconds field is not set.
if the cronjob controller happens to be down from 08:29:00 to 10:21:00, the job will not start as the number of missed jobs which missed their schedule is greater than 100.
to illustrate this concept further, suppose a cronjob is set to schedule a new job every one minute beginning at 08:30:00, and its startingdeadlineseconds is set to 200 seconds.
if the cronjob controller happens to be down for the same period as the previous example (08:29:00 to 10:21:00,) the job will still start at 10:22:00.
this happens as the controller now checks how many missed schedules happened in the last 200 seconds (i.e., 3 missed schedules), rather than from the last scheduled time until now.
the cronjob is only responsible for creating jobs that match its schedule, and the job in turn is responsible for the management of the pods it represents.

run the example cronjob by using this command:

kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/job/cronjob.yaml

the output is similar to this:

cronjob.batch/hello created

after creating the cron job, get its status using this command:

kubectl get cronjob hello

the output is similar to this:

name    schedule      suspend   active   last schedule   age
hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        &lt;none&gt;          10s

as you can see from the results of the command, the cron job has not scheduled or run any jobs yet.
watch  for the job to be created in around one minute:

kubectl get jobs --watch

the output is similar to this:

name               completions   duration   age
hello-4111706356   0/1                      0s
hello-4111706356   0/1           0s         0s
hello-4111706356   1/1           5s         5s

now you've seen one running job scheduled by the ""hello"" cron job.
you can stop watching the job and view the cron job again to see that it scheduled the job:

kubectl get cronjob hello

the output is similar to this:

name    schedule      suspend   active   last schedule   age
hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        50s             75s

you should see that the cron job hello successfully scheduled a job at the time specified in last schedule.
there are currently 0 active jobs, meaning that the job has completed or failed.
now, find the pods that the last scheduled job created and view the standard output of one of the pods.
note: the job name is different from the pod name.

# replace ""hello-4111706356"" with the job name in your system
pods=$(kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=hello-4111706356 --output=jsonpath={.items[*].metadata.name})

show the pod log:

kubectl logs $pods

the output is similar to this:

(running automated tasks with a cronjob  takes you through this example in more detail).
======================================== unsupported timezone specification specifying a timezone using cron_tz or tz variables inside

.spec.schedule

is not officially supported (and never has been).
starting with kubernetes 1.29 if you try to set a schedule that includes tz or cron_tz timezone specification, kubernetes will fail to create the resource with a validation error.
updates to cronjobs already using tz or cron_tz will continue to report a warning  to the client.
modifying a cronjob by design, a cronjob contains a template for new jobs.
if you modify an existing cronjob, the changes you make will apply to new jobs that start to run after your modification is complete.
jobs (and their pods) that have already started continue to run without changes.
that is, the cronjob does not update existing jobs, even if those remain running.
job creation a cronjob creates a job object approximately once per execution time of its schedule.
the scheduling is approximate because there are certain circumstances where two jobs might be created, or no job might be created.
kubernetes tries to avoid those situations, but does not completely prevent them.
therefore, the jobs that you define should be idempotent .
starting with kubernetes v1.32, cronjobs apply an annotation

batch.kubernetes.io/cronjob-scheduled-timestamp

to their created jobs.
this annotation indicates the originally scheduled creation time for the job and is formatted in rfc3339.
if startingdeadlineseconds is set to a large value or left unset (the default) and if concurrencypolicy is set to allow, the jobs will always run at least once.
caution: if startingdeadlineseconds is set to a value less than 10 seconds, the cronjob may not be scheduled.
this is because the cronjob controller checks things every 10 seconds.
for every cronjob, the cronjob controller  checks how many schedules it missed in the duration from its last scheduled time until now.
if there are more than 100 missed schedules, then it does not start the job and logs the error.

cannot determine if job needs to be started. too many missed start time (&gt; 100). set or decrease .spec.startingdeadlineseconds or check clock skew.

it is important to note that if the startingdeadlineseconds field is set (not nil), the controller counts how many missed jobs occurred from the value of startingdeadlineseconds until now rather than from the last scheduled time until now.
for example, if startingdeadlineseconds is 200, the controller counts how many missed jobs occurred in the last 200 seconds.
a cronjob is counted as missed if it has failed to be created at its scheduled time.
for example, if concurrencypolicy is set to forbid and a cronjob was attempted to be scheduled when there was a previous schedule still running, then it would count as missed.
for example, suppose a cronjob is set to schedule a new job every one minute beginning at 08:30:00, and its startingdeadlineseconds field is not set.
if the cronjob controller happens to be down from 08:29:00 to 10:21:00, the job will not start as the number of missed jobs which missed their schedule is greater than 100.
to illustrate this concept further, suppose a cronjob is set to schedule a new job every one minute beginning at 08:30:00, and its startingdeadlineseconds is set to 200 seconds.
if the cronjob controller happens to be down for the same period as the previous example (08:29:00 to 10:21:00,) the job will still start at 10:22:00.
this happens as the controller now checks how many missed schedules happened in the last 200 seconds (i.e., 3 missed schedules), rather than from the last scheduled time until now.
the cronjob is only responsible for creating jobs that match its schedule, and the job in turn is responsible for the management of the pods it represents.

```","1563, 304, 306","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**. 

Here are the specific points of comparison:

1. **Missing ServiceAccount**: The ""rag answer"" does not include the definition of a `ServiceAccount`, which is necessary for the `CronJob` to have the appropriate permissions to execute the `kubectl patch` command. The reference answer includes a `ServiceAccount` named `sa-jp-runner`, which is crucial for RBAC permissions.

2. **Missing Role and RoleBinding**: The ""rag answer"" also omits the `Role` and `RoleBinding` definitions that grant the necessary permissions to the `ServiceAccount`. The reference answer includes these components to ensure that the `ServiceAccount` has the ability to patch deployments.

3. **API Version for CronJob**: The ""rag answer"" uses `apiVersion: batch/v1`, while the reference answer uses `apiVersion: batch/v1beta1`. Depending on the Kubernetes version, `batch/v1beta1` may be required for compatibility with certain features of `CronJob`. However, this may not be a critical error if the Kubernetes version supports `batch/v1`.

In summary, the ""rag answer"" lacks essential components (ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding) that are necessary for the `CronJob` to function correctly, making it incorrect."
46734784,kubernetes nginx ingress controller not picking up tls certificates,"i setup a new kubernetes cluster on gke using the nginx-ingress controller. tls is not working, it's using the fake certificates.

there is a lot of configuration detail so i made a repo - https://github.com/jobevers/test_ssl_ingress

in short the steps were


create a new cluster without gke's load balancer
create a tls secret with my key and cert
create an nginx-ingress deployment / pod
create an ingress controller


the nginx-ingress config comes from https://zihao.me/post/cheap-out-google-container-engine-load-balancer/ (and looks very similar to a lot of the examples in the ingress-nginx repo).

my ingress.yaml is nearly identical to the example one

when i run curl, i get 

$ curl -kv https://35.196.134.52
[...]
*    common name: kubernetes ingress controller fake certificate (does not match '35.196.134.52')
[...]
*    issuer: o=acme co,cn=kubernetes ingress controller fake certificate
[...]


which shows that i'm still using the default certificates.

how am i supposed to get it using mine?

creating the secret:

kubectl create secret tls tls-secret --key tls/privkey.pem --cert tls/fullchain.pem




debugging further, the certificate is being found and exist on the server:

default-tls-secret-full-chain.pem

and, from the log, i see

### Explanation
It appears that the ingress definition needs to be updated to the new API version. The `host` entry specified under the `rules` section must correspond to one of the `hosts` entries defined under the `tls` section. This ensures that the ingress is properly configured for SSL termination with the specified secret.","till now we have only accessed the nginx server from within the cluster.
before exposing the service to the internet, you want to make sure the communication channel is secure.
for this, you will need: self signed certificates for https (unless you already have an identity certificate) an nginx server configured to use the certificates a secret  that makes the certificates accessible to pods you can acquire all these from the nginx https example .
this requires having go and make tools installed.
if you don't want to install those, then follow the manual steps later.

kubectl create secret tls nginxsecret --key /tmp/nginx.key --cert /tmp/nginx.crt

example     please check the [client-certs](../../examples/auth/client-certs/readme.md) example.  !!! attention     tls with client authentication is **not** possible in cloudflare and might result in unexpected behavior.      cloudflare only allows authenticated origin pulls and is required to use their own certificate: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-the-origin-with-tls-authenticated-origin-pulls/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/protecting-the-origin-with-tls-authenticated-origin-pulls/)      only authenticated origin pulls are allowed and can be configured by following their tutorial: [https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204494148-setting-up-nginx-to-use-tls-authenticated-origin-pulls](https://web.archive.org/web/20200907143649/https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204899617-setting-up-nginx-to-use-tls-authenticated-origin-pulls#section5) official document: the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough` instructs the controller to send tls connections directly to the backend instead of letting nginx decrypt the communication. see also [tls/https](../tls.md#ssl-passthrough) in the user guide.  !!! note     ssl passthrough is **disabled by default** and requires starting the controller with the     [`--enable-ssl-passthrough`](../cli-arguments.md) flag.  !!! attention     because ssl passthrough works on layer 4 of the osi model (tcp) and not on the layer 7 (http), using ssl passthrough     invalidates all the other annotations set on an ingress object.","```yaml

### Specific Issues:
1. **Host Mismatch**: The `hosts` entry under the `tls` section specifies an IP address (`35.196.134.52`), while the `host` entry under the `rules` section also uses the same IP address. The reference answer uses a domain name (`app.example.com`). In a typical Ingress configuration, the `hosts` should correspond to a domain name rather than an IP address, especially when SSL termination is involved.

2. **Lack of Domain Name**: The use of an IP address instead of a domain name is not standard practice for SSL configurations in Ingress resources. This could lead to issues with certificate validation, as SSL certificates are usually issued for domain names.

3. **No Explanation Provided**: The rag answer does not include an explanation of the changes made or the reasoning behind them, which is important for understanding the configuration.

In summary, the rag answer fails to follow best practices for Ingress configurations related to SSL, making it incorrect."
54884735,how to use configmap configuration with helm nginx ingress controller - kubernetes,"i've found a documentation about how to configure your nginx ingress controller using configmap: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/configmap/

unfortunately i've no idea and couldn't find it anywhere how to load that configmap from my ingress controller.

my ingress controller:

helm install --name ingress --namespace ingress-nginx --set rbac.create=true,controller.kind=daemonset,controller.service.type=clusterip,controller.hostnetwork=true stable/nginx-ingress


my config map:

kind: configmap

### Explanation
I was able to see the YAML that gets executed by Helm by using the `--dry-run --debug` options at the end of the `helm install` command. During this process, I observed that the controller is executed with the following configuration: `--configmap={namespace-where-the-nginx-ingress-is-deployed}/{name-of-the-helm-chart}-nginx-ingress-controller`. To load your custom ConfigMap, you will need to override it with your own, so make sure to check the namespace. You can find the complete list of configurable properties in the documentation.","ingress backed by a single service there are existing kubernetes concepts that allow you to expose a single service (see alternatives ).
you can also do this with an ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.

if you create it using

kubectl apply -f

you should be able to view the state of the ingress you added:

kubectl get ingress test-ingress

note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.

name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the `apiVersion` of the Ingress resource to `networking.k8s.io/v1`, which is the current version for Ingress resources.
2. Changed the `backend` structure to match the `networking.k8s.io/v1` specification, using `service` instead of `serviceName` and `servicePort`.
3. Added `pathType: Prefix` to the paths, which is required in the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API version.","344, 3393, 340","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**. Here are the specific points of correctness and incorrectness:

### Correct Aspects:
1. **YAML Structure**: The overall structure of the YAML is correct, as it includes the necessary components (ConfigMap, Deployment, and Ingress).
2. **Ingress API Version**: The use of `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1` is correct, as this is the current version for Ingress resources.
3. **PathType**: The inclusion of `pathType: Prefix` is correct and required in the `networking.k8s.io/v1` specification.

### Incorrect Aspects:
1. **ConfigMap Name and Namespace**: The name of the ConfigMap (`ingress-nginx-controller`) and the namespace (`ingress-nginx`) are hardcoded and do not follow the template format provided in the reference answer (`{name-of-the-helm-chart}-nginx-ingress-controller` and `{namespace-where-the-nginx-ingress-is-deployed}`). This makes it less flexible and not aligned with the reference answer.
2. **Key Name in ConfigMap**: The key `client-max-body-size` in the ConfigMap is incorrect. The reference answer uses `proxy-body-size`, which is the correct key for configuring the maximum body size for the NGINX ingress controller.
3. **Timeout Format**: The value for `proxy-read-timeout` is specified as `""86400s""` in the rag answer, while the reference answer uses `""86400""` (without the 's'). The format should be consistent with the reference answer.

### Conclusion:
The ""rag answer"" is incorrect due to the discrepancies in the ConfigMap name, key names, and the format of the timeout value."
61355744,how do i make sure my cronjob job does not retry on failure?,"i have a kubernetes cronjob that runs on gke and runs cucumber jvm tests. in case a step fails due to assertion failure, some resource being unavailable, etc., cucumber rightly throws an exception which leads the cronjob job to fail and the kubernetes pod's status changes to error. this leads to creation of a new pod that tries to run the same cucumber tests again, which fails again and retries again.

i don't want any of these retries to happen. if a cronjob job fails, i want it to remain in the failed status and not retry at all. based on this, i have already tried setting backofflimit: 0 in combination with restartpolicy: never in combination with concurrencypolicy: forbid, but it still retries by creating new pods and running the tests again. 

what am i missing? here's my kube manifest for the cronjob:

            - -c
            - non-existing-command
          restartPolicy: Never
```

### Explanation
To simplify the testing process, I utilized an example from the official Kubernetes documentation, making minor adjustments to demonstrate various scenarios. I can confirm that when `backoffLimit` is set to 0 and `restartPolicy` is set to Never, the behavior is as expected, with no retries occurring. It's important to note that each execution of your job, which in this case is scheduled to run every 60 seconds (`schedule: ""*/1 * * * *""`), is not considered a retry.

Let's examine the following example (base YAML available here):

This configuration spawns a new CronJob every 60 seconds according to the schedule, regardless of whether it fails or succeeds. In this specific instance, it is set to fail since we are attempting to execute a non-existent command.

You can observe the status by running:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1587558720-pgqq9   0/1     Error               0          61s
hello-1587558780-gpzxl   0/1     ContainerCreating    0          1s
```

As shown, there are no retries. Even though the first pod failed, a new one is created exactly 60 seconds later as specified. I want to emphasize that this is not a retry.

Conversely, if we modify the example to set `backoffLimit: 3`, we can observe retries in action. In this case, new pods are created more frequently than every 60 seconds, indicating retries.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1587565260-7db6j   0/1     Error    0          106s
hello-1587565260-tcqhv   0/1     Error    0          104s
hello-1587565260-vnbcl   0/1     Error    0          94s
hello-1587565320-7nc6z   0/1     Error    0          44s
hello-1587565320-l4p8r   0/1     Error    0          14s
hello-1587565320-mjnb6   0/1     Error    0          46s
hello-1587565320-wqbm2   0/1     Error    0          34s
```

Here, we see three retries (pod creation attempts) associated with the `hello-1587565260` job and four retries (including the original attempt, which is not counted in the `backoffLimit: 3`) related to the `hello-1587565320` job.

The jobs themselves continue to run according to the schedule, at 60-second intervals:

```bash
kubectl get jobs
NAME               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
hello-1587565260   0/1           2m12s      2m12s
hello-1587565320   0/1           72s        72s
hello-1587565380   0/1           11s        11s
```

However, due to the `backoffLimit` set to 3, every time the pod responsible for executing the job fails, three additional retries are initiated.

I hope this clarifies any potential confusion regarding the operation of CronJobs in Kubernetes. If you're interested in executing a task just once rather than at regular intervals, consider using a simple Job instead of a CronJob. Additionally, if you wish to run this specific job regularly but less frequently, such as once every 24 hours, you may want to adjust your Cron configuration accordingly.","with the following example, you can learn how to use pod failure policy to ignore pod disruptions from incrementing the pod retry counter towards the

### Specific Points of Evaluation:

1. **YAML Structure**: The YAML structure in the ""rag answer"" is valid and follows the correct format for defining a CronJob in Kubernetes.

2. **Schedule**: The schedule is set to `""*/1 * * * *""`, which is correct and indicates that the job will run every minute, similar to the reference answer.

3. **Backoff Limit and Restart Policy**: The ""rag answer"" correctly sets `backoffLimit: 0` and `restartPolicy: Never`, which aligns with the reference answer's explanation about preventing retries on failure.

4. **Concurrency Policy**: The inclusion of `concurrencyPolicy: Forbid` is an additional feature that is not present in the reference answer. This setting is valid and ensures that if a job is still running, a new job will not start, which is a useful configuration.

5. **Container Configuration**: The container configuration, including the image, environment variables, and volume mounts, is valid. However, the image name (`foo-image-path`) is a placeholder and should be replaced with a valid image path for actual deployment.

6. **Arguments**: The arguments provided for the container are appropriate for a Java application, which is a valid use case for a CronJob.

45720084,how to make two kubernetes services talk to each other?,"currently, i have working k8s api pods in a k8s service that connects to a k8s redis service, with k8s pods of it's own. the problem is, i am using nodeport meaning both are exposed to the public. i only want the api accessable to the public. the issue is that if i make the redis service not public, the api can't see it. is there a way to connect two services without exposing one to the public?

this is my api service yaml:  

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
   name: app-api-svc
spec:
   selector:
     app: app-api
     tier: api
   ports:
     - protocol: tcp
       port: 5000
       nodeport: 30400
   type: nodeport


and this is my redis service yaml:

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
   name: app-api-redis-svc
spec:
   selector:
     app: app-api-redis
     tier: celery_broker

      targetPort: [the port exposed by the Redis pod]
```
### Explanation
To begin with, you need to set up the Redis service as a ClusterIP service, which will make it accessible only to other services within the cluster. This can be achieved by omitting the line that specifies the service type. 

When configuring your API to connect to Redis, you should use the address `app-api-redis-svc:6379`. 

That's all there is to it! I have numerous services that communicate with each other in this manner. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out in the comments.","the guestbook application uses redis to store its data.
creating the redis deployment the manifest file, included below, specifies a deployment controller that runs a single replica redis pod.

launch a terminal window in the directory you downloaded the manifest files.
apply the redis deployment from the

redis-leader-deployment.yaml

file:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/redis-leader-deployment.yaml

query the list of pods to verify that the redis pod is running:

kubectl get pods

the response should be similar to this:

run the following command to view the logs from the redis leader pod:

kubectl logs -f deployment/redis-leader

creating the redis leader service the guestbook application needs to communicate to the redis to write its data.
you need to apply a service  to proxy the traffic to the redis pod.
a service defines a policy to access the pods.

redis-leader   clusterip   10.103.78.24 &lt;none&gt;        6379/tcp   16s

note: this manifest file creates a service named redis-leader with a set of labels that match the labels previously defined, so the service routes network traffic to the redis pod.
set up redis followers although the redis leader is a single pod, you can make it highly available and meet traffic demands by adding a few redis followers, or replicas.

apply the redis deployment from the following

redis-follower-deployment.yaml

file:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/redis-follower-deployment.yaml

verify that the two redis follower replicas are running by querying the list of pods:

kubectl get pods

the response should be similar to this:

redis-follower-dddfbd","a service is an object  (the same way that a pod or a configmap is an object).
you can create, view or modify service definitions using the kubernetes api.
usually you use a tool such as kubectl to make those api calls for you.
for example, suppose you have a set of pods that each listen on tcp port 9376 and are labelled as

app.kubernetes.io/name=myapp

.
you can define a service to publish that tcp listener: service/simple-service.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: tcp
      port: 80
      targetport: 9376

applying this manifest creates a new service named ""my-service"" with the default clusterip service type .
the service targets tcp port 9376 on any pod with the

app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp

label.
kubernetes assigns this service an ip address (the cluster ip ), that is used by the virtual ip address mechanism.
for more details on that mechanism, read virtual ips and service proxies .
the controller for that service continuously scans for pods that match its selector, and then makes any necessary updates to the set of endpointslices for the service.
the name of a service object must be a valid rfc 1035 label name .
note: a service can map any incoming port to a targetport.
by default and for convenience, the targetport is set to the same value as the port field.
port definitions port definitions in pods have names, and you can reference these names in the targetport attribute of a service.
for example, we can bind the targetport of the service to the pod port in the following way:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - containerport: 80
        name: http-web-svc

---
apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
  ports:
  - name: name-of-service-port
    protocol: tcp
    port: 80
    targetport: http-web-svc

this works even if there is a mixture of pods in the service using a single configured name, with the same network protocol available via different port numbers.
this offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving your services.
for example, you can change the port numbers that pods expose in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.
the default protocol for services is tcp ; you can also use any other supported protocol .
because many services need to expose more than one port, kubernetes supports multiple port definitions  for a single service.
each port definition can have the same protocol, or a different one.
services without selectors services most commonly abstract access to kubernetes pods thanks to the selector, but when used with a corresponding set of endpointslices  objects and without a selector, the service can abstract other kinds of backends, including ones that run outside the cluster.
for example: you want to have an external database cluster in production, but in your test environment you use your own databases.
you want to point your service to a service in a different namespace  or on another cluster.
you are migrating a workload to kubernetes.
while evaluating the approach, you run only a portion of your backends in kubernetes.
in any of these scenarios you can define a service without specifying a selector to match pods.
for example:

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: tcp
      port: 80
      targetport: 9376

because this service has no selector, the corresponding endpointslice (and legacy endpoints) objects are not created automatically.
you can map the service to the network address and port where it's running, by adding an endpointslice object manually.
for example:

apiversion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: endpointslice
metadata:
  name: my-service-1 # by convention, use the name of the service
                     # as a prefix for the name of the endpointslice
  labels:
   ","for clients running inside your cluster, kubernetes supports two primary modes of finding a service: environment variables and dns.
environment variables when a pod is run on a node, the kubelet adds a set of environment variables for each active service.
it adds {svcname}_service_host and {svcname}_service_port variables, where the service name is upper-cased and dashes are converted to underscores.
for example, the service redis-primary which exposes tcp port 6379 and has been allocated cluster ip address 10.0.0.11, produces the following environment variables:

redis_primary_service_host=10.0.0.11
redis_primary_service_port=6379
redis_primary_port=tcp://10.0.0.11:6379
redis_primary_port_6379_tcp=tcp://10.0.0.11:6379
redis_primary_port_6379_tcp_proto=tcp
redis_primary_port_6379_tcp_port=6379
redis_primary_port_6379_tcp_addr=10.0.0.11

note: when you have a pod that needs to access a service, and you are using the environment variable method to publish the port and cluster ip to the client pods, you must create the service before the client pods come into existence.
otherwise, those client pods won't have their environment variables populated.
if you only use dns to discover the cluster ip for a service, you don't need to worry about this ordering issue.
kubernetes also supports and provides variables that are compatible with docker engine's "" legacy container links  "" feature.
you can read makelinkvariables  to see how this is implemented in kubernetes.
dns you can (and almost always should) set up a dns service for your kubernetes cluster using an add-on .
a cluster-aware dns server, such as coredns, watches the kubernetes api for new services and creates a set of dns records for each one.
if dns has been enabled throughout your cluster then all pods should automatically be able to resolve services by their dns name.
for example, if you have a service called my-service in a kubernetes namespace my-ns, the control plane and the dns service acting together create a dns record for

my-service.my-ns

.
pods in the my-ns namespace should be able to find the service by doing a name lookup for my-service (

my-service.my-ns

would also work).
pods in other namespaces must qualify the name as

my-service.my-ns

.
these names will resolve to the cluster ip assigned for the service.
kubernetes also supports dns srv (service) records for named ports.
if the

my-service.my-ns

service has a port named http with the protocol set to tcp, you can do a dns srv query for

_http._tcp.my-service.my-ns

to discover the port number for http, as well as the ip address.
the kubernetes dns server is the only way to access externalname services.
you can find more information about externalname resolution in dns for services and pods .
virtual ip addressing mechanismread virtual ips and service proxies explains the mechanism kubernetes provides to expose a service with a virtual ip address.traffic policiesyou can set the .spec.internaltrafficpolicy and .spec.externaltrafficpolicy fields to control how kubernetes routes traffic to healthy (“ready”) backends.see traffic policies for more details.traffic distributionfeature state: kubernetes v1.31 [beta] (enabled by default: true)the .spec.trafficdistribution field provides another way to influence traffic routing within a kubernetes service.
while traffic policies focus on strict semantic guarantees, traffic distribution allows you to express preferences (such as routing to topologically closer endpoints).
this can help optimize for performance, cost, or reliability.
this optional field can be used if you have enabled the servicetrafficdistribution feature gate for your cluster and all of its nodes.
in kubernetes 1.32, the following field value is supported:prefercloseindicates a preference for routing traffic to endpoints that are topologically proximate to the client.

Here are the specific points of error:

1. **Service Type for Redis**: The reference answer specifies that the Redis service should be a ClusterIP service, which is correctly reflected in the rag answer. However, the rag answer also includes a `NodePort` service for `app-api-svc`, which is not part of the original question or context provided in the reference answer. The reference answer does not mention a public-facing service for the API, and the rag answer introduces unnecessary complexity by including a separate service definition for `app-api`.

2. **Inconsistent Naming**: The `app-api-svc` in the rag answer does not match the naming convention or context of the reference answer, which focuses solely on the Redis service. The reference answer does not mention an API service, making the inclusion of `app-api-svc` irrelevant.

3. **Incorrect YAML Formatting**: The YAML formatting in the rag answer has issues, such as inconsistent casing for `apiversion` and `kind`, which should be `apiVersion` and `kind` respectively. YAML is case-sensitive, and this could lead to errors when applying the configuration.

In summary, while the rag answer correctly identifies the need for the Redis service to be a ClusterIP, it introduces unrelated elements and formatting issues that make it incorrect overall."

### Explanation
The capability to autoscale StatefulSets using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) was introduced in Kubernetes version 1.9, which means that earlier versions do not support this feature. If you are using Kubernetes 1.9 or later, you can implement autoscaling for your StatefulSets as shown in the YAML example above. For further details, you can refer to the following link: 

[GitHub Issue #44033](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/44033)","graph bt hpa[horizontal pod autoscaler] --> scale[scale] subgraph rc[rc / deployment] scale end scale -.-> pod1[pod 1] scale -.-> pod2[pod 2] scale -.-> pod3[pod n] classdef hpa fill:#d5a6bd,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; classdef rc fill:#f9cb9c,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; classdef scale fill:#b6d7a8,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; classdef pod fill:#9fc5e8,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; class hpa hpa; class rc rc; class scale scale; class pod1,pod2,pod3 pod javascript must be enabled  to view this content figure 1.
horizontalpodautoscaler controls the scale of a deployment and its replicaset kubernetes implements horizontal pod autoscaling as a control loop that runs intermittently (it is not a continuous process).
the interval is set by the --horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period parameter to the kube-controller-manager  (and the default interval is 15 seconds).
once during each period, the controller manager queries the resource utilization against the metrics specified in each horizontalpodautoscaler definition.
the controller manager finds the target resource defined by the scaletargetref, then selects the pods based on the target resource's

.spec.selector

labels, and obtains the metrics from either the resource metrics api (for per-pod resource metrics), or the custom metrics api (for all other metrics).
for per-pod resource metrics (like cpu), the controller fetches the metrics from the resource metrics api for each pod targeted by the horizontalpodautoscaler.
then, if a target utilization value is set, the controller calculates the utilization value as a percentage of the equivalent resource request  on the containers in each pod.
if a target raw value is set, the raw metric values are used directly.
the controller then takes the mean of the utilization or the raw value (depending on the type of target specified) across all targeted pods, and produces a ratio used to scale the number of desired replicas.
please note that if some of the pod's containers do not have the relevant resource request set, cpu utilization for the pod will not be defined and the autoscaler will not take any action for that metric.
see the algorithm details  section below for more information about how the autoscaling algorithm works.
for per-pod custom metrics, the controller functions similarly to per-pod resource metrics, except that it works with raw values, not utilization values.
for object metrics and external metrics, a single metric is fetched, which describes the object in question.
this metric is compared to the target value, to produce a ratio as above.
in the autoscaling/v2 api version, this value can optionally be divided by the number of pods before the comparison is made.
the common use for horizontalpodautoscaler is to configure it to fetch metrics from aggregated apis  (

metrics.k8s.io

,

custom.metrics.k8s.io

, or

external.metrics.k8s.io

).
the

metrics.k8s.io

api is usually provided by an add-on named metrics server, which needs to be launched separately.
for more information about resource metrics, see metrics server .
support for metrics apis  explains the stability guarantees and support status for these different apis.
the horizontalpodautoscaler controller accesses corresponding workload resources that support scaling (such as deployments and statefulset).
these resources each have a subresource named scale, an interface that allows you to dynamically set the number of replicas and examine each of their current states.
for general information about subresources in the kubernetes api, see kubernetes api concepts .
algorithm details from the most basic perspective, the horizontalpodautoscaler controller operates on the ratio between desired metric value and current metric value:

desiredreplicas = ceil[currentreplicas * ( currentmetricvalue / desiredmetricvalue )]

for example, if the current metric value is 200m, and the desired value is 100m, the number of replicas will be doubled, since

200.0 / 100.0 == 2.0

if the current value is instead","when using the autoscaling/v2 form of the horizontalpodautoscaler, you will be able to see status conditions set by kubernetes on the horizontalpodautoscaler.
these status conditions indicate whether or not the horizontalpodautoscaler is able to scale, and whether or not it is currently restricted in any way.
the conditions appear in the

status.conditions

field.

the replica count of the target is not zero) and is able to calculate desired scales.
when it is false, it generally indicates problems with fetching metrics.
finally, the last condition, scalinglimited, indicates that the desired scale was capped by the maximum or minimum of the horizontalpodautoscaler.
this is an indication that you may wish to raise or lower the minimum or maximum replica count constraints on your horizontalpodautoscaler.
========================================","any hpa target can be scaled based on the resource usage of the pods in the scaling target.
when defining the pod specification the resource requests like cpu and memory should be specified.
this is used to determine the resource utilization and used by the hpa controller to scale the target up or down.
to use resource utilization based scaling specify a metric source like this:

type: resource
resource:
  name: cpu
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60

with this metric the hpa controller will keep the average utilization of the pods in the scaling target at 60%.
utilization is the ratio between the current usage of resource to the requested resources of the pod.
see algorithm  for more details about how the utilization is calculated and averaged.
note: since the resource usages of all the containers are summed up the total pod utilization may not accurately represent the individual container resource usage.
this could lead to situations where a single container might be running with high usage and the hpa will not scale out because the overall pod usage is still within acceptable limits.
container resource metrics feature state:

kubernetes v1.30 [stable]

(enabled by default: true) the horizontalpodautoscaler api also supports a container metric source where the hpa can track the resource usage of individual containers across a set of pods, in order to scale the target resource.
this lets you configure scaling thresholds for the containers that matter most in a particular pod.
for example, if you have a web application and a sidecar container that provides logging, you can scale based on the resource use of the web application, ignoring the sidecar container and its resource use.
if you revise the target resource to have a new pod specification with a different set of containers, you should revise the hpa spec if that newly added container should also be used for scaling.
if the specified container in the metric source is not present or only present in a subset of the pods then those pods are ignored and the recommendation is recalculated.
see algorithm  for more details about the calculation.
to use container resources for autoscaling define a metric source as follows:

type: containerresource
containerresource:
  name: cpu
  container: application
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60

in the above example the hpa controller scales the target such that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is 60%.
note: if you change the name of a container that a horizontalpodautoscaler is tracking, you can make that change in a specific order to ensure scaling remains available and effective whilst the change is being applied.
before you update the resource that defines the container (such as a deployment), you should update the associated hpa to track both the new and old container names.
this way, the hpa is able to calculate a scaling recommendation throughout the update process.
once you have rolled out the container name change to the workload resource, tidy up by removing the old container name from the hpa specification.

### Correct Aspects:
1. **API Version**: The ""rag answer"" uses `autoscaling/v2beta2`, which is a valid API version for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and supports more advanced metrics compared to `autoscaling/v1`.
2. **Kind**: It correctly specifies `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` as the kind.
3. **Scale Target Reference**: It correctly references a `StatefulSet` in the `scaleTargetRef`.
4. **Min and Max Replicas**: It correctly specifies `minReplicas` and `maxReplicas`.
5. **Metrics**: It includes a metrics section, which is valid in `autoscaling/v2beta2` and allows for more flexible scaling based on resource utilization.

### Incorrect Aspects:
1. **Min Replicas**: The ""rag answer"" sets `minReplicas` to 2, while the ""reference answer"" sets it to 1. This is not necessarily incorrect, but it may not align with the specific scaling needs of the application.
2. **Naming**: The name `dz-es-cluster` in the ""rag answer"" is different from the placeholder `your_hpa_name` in the ""reference answer"". While this is not incorrect, it is important to ensure that the name is meaningful and relevant to the application.

It's important to note that there are three types of NGINX: the open-source NGINX Ingress Controller (which you are likely using), NGINX Inc., and NGINX Inc. Plus. In one of my scenarios, when I specified `spec.controller: nginx.org/ingress-controller` with the NGINX Ingress Controller using `--ingress-class=nginx`, the NGINX Ingress Controller pod entered a crash loop. The logs indicated an invalid `IngressClass` (spec.controller) value of ""nginx.org/ingress-controller"", which should be ""k8s.io/ingress-nginx"".

To replicate this behavior, you need to deploy an `IngressClass` with the specific controller and then deploy NGINX. 

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: IngressClass
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  controller: nginx.org/ingress-controller
```

After deploying the NGINX Ingress Controller, the controller pod will be in a crash loop state. The logs will show an error indicating that the `spec.controller` value is invalid. It only works when the `IngressClass` name is set to `nginx`. 

I would suggest that `nginx.org/ingress-controller` is intended for NGINX Inc. and `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` is for the open-source NGINX Ingress. If a custom value is used for the `--ingress-class` argument in the controller deployment manifest, the presence or absence of an `IngressClass` object with the same name does not affect cluster behavior, as long as the `ingressClassName` in the `Ingress` spec matches the controller argument. Furthermore, if the `IngressClass` is present, the `spec.controller` can have any value that matches the required ""domain-like"" pattern without impacting the `Ingress` workflow.

Additionally, the `Ingress` functions correctly if the correct value for the `ingress-class` is set either in the `spec.ingressClassName` property or in the `metadata.annotations.kubernetes.io/ingress.class`. However, if both values are set in the same `Ingress` object, it will result in an error:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
```

The error message will indicate that the `Ingress` ""test-ingress"" is invalid because the annotation and the class field cannot be set simultaneously. Please note that this was tested only with the NGINX Ingress Controller. If you plan to use `IngressClass` with other controllers like Traefik or Ambassador, be sure to check their release notes for compatibility.","ingresses can be implemented by different controllers, often with different configuration.
each ingress should specify a class, a reference to an ingressclass resource that contains additional configuration including the name of the controller that should implement the class.

2. **IngressClass Name**: The rag answer uses `external-lb` as the name for the `IngressClass`, which is different from the `nginx` name used in the reference answer. While this is not inherently incorrect, it does not align with the context of the reference answer, which specifically discusses the `nginx` IngressClass.

3. **Parameters Section**: The rag answer introduces a `parameters` section with `apigroup`, `kind`, and `name`, which is not present in the reference answer. The reference answer does not mention any parameters for the `IngressClass`, and the inclusion of this section without context may lead to confusion.

",<kubernetes><kubernetes-deployment>,54438715,21,"```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
```

### Explanation
The first label is designated for the deployment itself, providing a specific label for that deployment. For instance, if you wish to delete the deployment, you can execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment -l app=nginx
```

This command will remove the entire deployment.

The second label is the selector, specifically `matchLabels`, which instructs resources (like services) to match pods based on their labels. For example, if you want to create a service that targets all pods labeled with `app=nginx`, you would use the definition provided above.

The service will search for the specified `matchLabels` and bind to the pods that have the label `app: nginx` assigned to them.

The third label pertains to the pod template labels. The template refers to the pod template that describes the pods to be launched. For instance, if you have a deployment with two replicas, Kubernetes will create two pods with the labels specified in the template's `metadata.labels`. This distinction is subtle but significant, as it allows for different labels for the deployment and the pods generated by that deployment.","the following is an example of a deployment.
it creates a replicaset to bring up three nginx pods: controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml 

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerport: 80

in this example: a deployment named nginx-deployment is created, indicated by the

.metadata.name

field.
this name will become the basis for the replicasets and pods which are created later.
see writing a deployment spec  for more details.
the deployment creates a replicaset that creates three replicated pods, indicated by the

.spec.replicas

field.
the

.spec.selector

field defines how the created replicaset finds which pods to manage.
in this case, you select a label that is defined in the pod template (app: nginx).
however, more sophisticated selection rules are possible, as long as the pod template itself satisfies the rule.
note: the

.spec.selector.matchlabels

field is a map of {key,value} pairs.
a single {key,value} in the matchlabels map is equivalent to an element of matchexpressions, whose key field is ""key"", the operator is ""in"", and the values array contains only ""value"".
all of the requirements, from both matchlabels and matchexpressions, must be satisfied in order to match.
the

.spec.template

field contains the following sub-fields: the pods are labeled app: nginxusing the

.metadata.labels

field.
the pod template's specification, or

.spec

field, indicates that the pods run one container, nginx, which runs the nginx docker hub  image at version 1.14.2.
create one container and name it nginx using the

.spec.containers[0].name

field.
before you begin, make sure your kubernetes cluster is up and running.
follow the steps given below to create the above deployment: create the deployment by running the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml

run

kubectl get deployments

to check if the deployment was created.
if the deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:

name               ready   up-to-date   available   age
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s

when you inspect the deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed: name lists the names of the deployments in the namespace.
ready displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
it follows the pattern ready/desired.
up-to-date displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
available displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
age displays the amount of time that the application has been running.
notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to

.spec.replicas

field.
to see the deployment rollout status, run

kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

.
the output is similar to:

waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
deployment ""nginx-deployment"" successfully rolled out

run the

kubectl get deployments

again a few seconds later.
the output is similar to this:

nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           18s

notice that the deployment has created all three replicas, and all replicas are up-to-date (they contain the latest pod template) and available.
to see the replicaset (rs) created by the deployment, run

kubectl get rs

.
the output is similar to this:

name                          desired   current   ready   age
nginx-deployment-75675f5897   3         3         3       18s

replicaset output shows the following fields: name lists the names of the replicasets in the namespace.
desired displays the desired number of replicas of the application, which you define when you create the deployment.
this is the desired state .
current displays how m","you can run an application by creating a kubernetes deployment object, and you can describe a deployment in a yaml file.

where <pod-name> is the name of one of your pods.
========================================","many applications require multiple resources to be created, such as a deployment along with a service.
management of multiple resources can be simplified by grouping them together in the same file (separated by --- in yaml).
for example: application/nginx-app.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-svc
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  type: loadbalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
---
apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerport: 80

multiple resources can be created the same way as a single resource:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/nginx-app.yaml



service/my-nginx-svc created
deployment.apps/my-nginx created

the resources will be created in the order they appear in the manifest.
therefore, it's best to specify the service first, since that will ensure the scheduler can spread the pods associated with the service as they are created by the controller(s), such as deployment.
kubectl apply also accepts multiple -f arguments:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/nginx/nginx-svc.yaml \
  -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/nginx/nginx-deployment.yaml

it is a recommended practice to put resources related to the same microservice or application tier into the same file, and to group all of the files associated with your application in the same directory.
if the tiers of your application bind to each other using dns, you can deploy all of the components of your stack together.
a url can also be specified as a configuration source, which is handy for deploying directly from manifests in your source control system:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/nginx/nginx-deployment.yaml



deployment.apps/my-nginx created

however, more sophisticated selection rules are possible, as long as the pod template itself satisfies the rule.
note: the

.spec.selector.matchlabels

field is a map of {key,value} pairs.
a single {key,value} in the matchlabels map is equivalent to an element of matchexpressions, whose key field is ""key"", the operator is ""in"", and the values array contains only ""value"".
all of the requirements, from both matchlabels and matchexpressions, must be satisfied in order to match.
the

.spec.template

field contains the following sub-fields: the pods are labeled app: nginxusing the

.metadata.labels

field.
the pod template's specification, or

.spec

field, indicates that the pods run one container, nginx, which runs the nginx docker hub  image at version 1.14.2.
create one container and name it nginx using the

.spec.containers[0].name

field.
before you begin, make sure your kubernetes cluster is up and running.
follow the steps given below to create the above deployment: create the deployment by running the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml

run

kubectl get deployments

to check if the deployment was created.
if the deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:

name               ready   up-to-date   available   age
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s

when you inspect the deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed: name lists the names of the deployments in the namespace.
ready displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
it follows the pattern ready/desired.
up-to-date displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
available displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
age displays the amount of time that the application has been running.
notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to

.spec.replicas

field.
to see the deployment rollout status, run

kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

.
the output is similar to:

waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
deployment ""nginx-deployment"" successfully rolled out

run the

kubectl get deployments

again a few seconds later.
the output is similar to this:

name               ready   up-to-date   available   age
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           18s

notice that the deployment has created all three replicas, and all replicas are up-to-date (they contain the latest pod template) and available.
to see the replicaset (rs) created by the deployment, run

kubectl get rs

.
the output is similar to this:

name                          desired   current   ready   age
nginx-deployment-75675f5897   3         3         3       18s

replicaset output shows the following fields: name lists the names of the replicasets in the namespace.
desired displays the desired number of replicas of the application, which you define when you create the deployment.
this is the desired state .
current displays how m you can run an application by creating a kubernetes deployment object, and you can describe a deployment in a yaml file.
for example, this yaml file describes a deployment that runs the nginx:1.14.2 docker image: application/deployment.yaml 

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:

display information about a pod:

kubectl describe pod &lt;pod-name&gt;

where <pod-name> is the name of one of your pods.
======================================== many applications require multiple resources to be created, such as a deployment along with a service.
management of multiple resources can be simplified by grouping them together in the same file (separated by --- in yaml).
for example: application/nginx-app.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-svc
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  type: loadbalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
---
apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerport: 80

multiple resources can be created the same way as a single resource:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/nginx-app.yaml



service/my-nginx-svc created
deployment.apps/my-nginx created

the resources will be created in the order they appear in the manifest.
therefore, it's best to specify the service first, since that will ensure the scheduler can spread the pods associated with the service as they are created by the controller(s), such as deployment.
kubectl apply also accepts multiple -f arguments:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/nginx/nginx-svc.yaml \
  -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/nginx/nginx-deployment.yaml

it is a recommended practice to put resources related to the same microservice or application tier into the same file, and to group all of the files associated with your application in the same directory.
if the tiers of your application bind to each other using dns, you can deploy all of the components of your stack together.
a url can also be specified as a configuration source, which is handy for deploying directly from manifests in your source control system:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/nginx/nginx-deployment.yaml



deployment.apps/my-nginx created

### Specific Points of Correctness:
1. **Correct API Version and Kind**: The ""rag answer"" uses `apiVersion: apps/v1` and `kind: deployment`, which is appropriate for defining a deployment in Kubernetes.
2. **Metadata Labels**: The explanation correctly identifies the purpose of the label in `metadata.labels` as identifying the deployment itself.
3. **Selector**: The use of `spec.selector.matchLabels` to match the pods managed by the deployment is accurately described.
4. **Pod Template Labels**: The explanation of `spec.template.metadata.labels` correctly states that this label is applied to the pods created by the deployment, allowing them to be identified by the selector.
5. **Container Specification**: The inclusion of the container specification with the image and port is appropriate and relevant for a deployment.

### Explanation
Secrets are designed to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords and private keys, while ConfigMaps are intended for non-sensitive configuration data. According to the documentation, a Secret is an object that holds a small amount of sensitive data, like a password, token, or key. On the other hand, a ConfigMap allows you to separate environment-specific configurations from your container images, making your applications more portable.

You can create a Secret and mount it as one or more files in your Pods. Below is a simple example demonstrating how this works. The sample includes a Secret manifest file and a Deployment that utilizes this Secret. Note that I used `subPath` with the Secrets, and it functions as expected.

Before deploying, ensure that the Secret is created. After creating both the Secret and Deployment, you can verify their functionality with the following commands:

```bash
$ kubectl get secret,deploy,pod
```

This will show the status of the Secret, Deployment, and Pod. You can also check the contents of the mounted files using:

```bash
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- ls /mnt
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat /mnt/secret.file1
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat /mnt/secret.file2
```

### Projected Volume
A more effective approach to achieve your goal is to use a projected volume. A projected volume allows you to map multiple existing volume sources into the same directory. The documentation provides a detailed explanation, but I have also created an example to illustrate how it works. In this example, I mounted `secret.file1`, `secret.file2` from a Secret, and `config.file1` from a ConfigMap as files within the Pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
data:
  secret.file1: |
    c2vjcmv0rmlsztek
  secret.file2: |
    c2vjcmv0rmlsztik
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  config.file1: |
    configfile1  
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: all-in-one
      mountPath: ""/config-volume""
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: my-secret
          items:
            - key: secret.file1
              path: secret-dir1/secret.file1
            - key: secret.file2
              path: secret-dir2/secret.file2
      - configMap:
          name: my-config
          items:
            - key: config.file1
              path: config-dir1/config.file1
```

You can verify the functionality of this setup with the following commands:

```bash
$ kubectl exec nginx -- ls /config-volume
$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/config-dir1/config.file1
$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/secret-dir1/secret.file1
$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/secret-dir2/secret.file2
```

If this response does not address your question, please provide more details about your Secret and your specific objectives.","here is a configuration file you can use to create a pod: pods/inject/secret-pod.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: secret-test-pod

  containers:
    - name: test-container

  # the secret data is exposed to containers in the pod through a volume.
  volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretname: test-secret

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/secret-pod.yaml

verify that your pod is running:

kubectl get pod secret-test-pod

output:

name              ready     status    restarts   age
secret-test-pod   1/1       running   0          42m

get a shell into the container that is running in your pod:

kubectl exec -i -t secret-test-pod -- /bin/bash

the secret data is exposed to the container through a volume mounted under /etc/secret-volume.
in your shell, list the files in the /etc/secret-volume directory:

# run this in the shell inside the container
ls /etc/secret-volume

the output shows two files, one for each piece of secret data: password username in your shell, display the contents of the username and password files:

# run this in the shell inside the container
echo ""$( cat /etc/secret-volume/username )""
echo ""$( cat /etc/secret-volume/password )""

the output is your username and password: my-app 39528$vdg7jb modify your image or command line so that the program looks for files in the mountpath directory.
each key in the secret data map becomes a file name in this directory.
project secret keys to specific file paths you can also control the paths within the volume where secret keys are projected.
use the

.spec.volumes[].secret.items

field to change the target path of each key:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      items:
      - key: username
        path: my-group/my-username

when you deploy this pod, the following happens: the username key from mysecret is available to the container at the path /etc/foo/my-group/my-username instead of at /etc/foo/username.
the password key from that secret object is not projected.
if you list keys explicitly using

.spec.volumes[].secret.items

, consider the following: only keys specified in items are projected.
to consume all keys from the secret, all of them must be listed in the items field.
all listed keys must exist in the corresponding secret.
otherwise, the volume is not created.
set posix permissions for secret keys you can set the posix file access permission bits for a single secret key.
if you don't specify any permissions, 0644 is used by default.
you can also set a default posix file mode for the entire secret volume, and you can override per key if needed.
for example, you can specify a default mode like this:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      defaultmode: 0400

the secret is mounted on /etc/foo; all the files created by the secret volume mount have permission 0400.
note: if you're defining a pod or a pod template using json, beware that the json specification doesn't support octal literals for numbers because json considers 0400 to be the decimal value 400.
in json, use decimal values for the defaultmode instead.
if you're writing yaml, you can write the defaultmode in octal.
========================================","in this exercise, you create username and password secrets  from local files.
you then create a pod that runs one container, using a projected  volume to mount the secrets into the same shared directory.
here is the configuration file for the pod: pods/storage/projected.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: test-projected-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test-projected-volume

      sources:
      - secret:
          name: user
      - secret:
          name: pass

create the secrets:

# create files containing the username and password:
echo -n ""admin"" &gt; ./username.txt
echo -n ""1f2d1e2e67df"" &gt; ./password.txt

# package these files into secrets:
kubectl create secret generic user --from-file=./username.txt
kubectl create secret generic pass --from-file=./password.txt

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/projected.yaml

verify that the pod's container is running, and then watch for changes to the pod:

kubectl get --watch pod test-projected-volume

the output looks like this:

test-projected-volume   1/1       running   0          14s

in another terminal, get a shell to the running container:

kubectl exec -it test-projected-volume -- /bin/sh

in your shell, verify that the projected-volume directory contains your projected sources: ls /projected-volume/ ========================================","creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.

  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      optional: true

by default, secrets are required.
none of a pod's containers will start until all non-optional secrets are available.
if a pod references a specific key in a non-optional secret and that secret does exist, but is missing the named key, the pod fails during startup.
using secrets as files from a pod if you want to access data from a secret in a pod, one way to do that is to have kubernetes make the value of that secret be available as a file inside the filesystem of one or more of the pod's containers.
for instructions, refer to create a pod that has access to the secret data through a volume .
when a volume contains data from a secret, and that secret is updated, kubernetes tracks this and updates the data in the volume, using an eventually-consistent approach.
note: a container using a secret as a subpath  volume mount does not receive automated secret updates.
the kubelet keeps a cache of the current keys and values for the secrets that are used in volume","here is a configuration file you can use to create a pod: pods/inject/secret-pod.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: secret-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: nginx
      volumemounts:
        # name must match the volume name below
        - name: secret-volume
          mountpath: /etc/secret-volume
          readonly: true
  # the secret data is exposed to containers in the pod through a volume.
  volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretname: test-secret

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/secret-pod.yaml

verify that your pod is running:

kubectl get pod secret-test-pod

output:

name              ready     status    restarts   age
secret-test-pod   1/1       running   0          42m

get a shell into the container that is running in your pod:

kubectl exec -i -t secret-test-pod -- /bin/bash

the secret data is exposed to the container through a volume mounted under /etc/secret-volume.
in your shell, list the files in the /etc/secret-volume directory:

# run this in the shell inside the container
ls /etc/secret-volume

the output shows two files, one for each piece of secret data: password username in your shell, display the contents of the username and password files:

# run this in the shell inside the container
echo ""$( cat /etc/secret-volume/username )""
echo ""$( cat /etc/secret-volume/password )""

the output is your username and password: my-app 39528$vdg7jb modify your image or command line so that the program looks for files in the mountpath directory.
each key in the secret data map becomes a file name in this directory.
project secret keys to specific file paths you can also control the paths within the volume where secret keys are projected.
use the

.spec.volumes[].secret.items

field to change the target path of each key:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      items:
      - key: username
        path: my-group/my-username

when you deploy this pod, the following happens: the username key from mysecret is available to the container at the path /etc/foo/my-group/my-username instead of at /etc/foo/username.
the password key from that secret object is not projected.
if you list keys explicitly using

.spec.volumes[].secret.items

, consider the following: only keys specified in items are projected.
to consume all keys from the secret, all of them must be listed in the items field.
all listed keys must exist in the corresponding secret.
otherwise, the volume is not created.
set posix permissions for secret keys you can set the posix file access permission bits for a single secret key.
if you don't specify any permissions, 0644 is used by default.
you can also set a default posix file mode for the entire secret volume, and you can override per key if needed.
for example, you can specify a default mode like this:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      defaultmode: 0400

the secret is mounted on /etc/foo; all the files created by the secret volume mount have permission 0400.
note: if you're defining a pod or a pod template using json, beware that the json specification doesn't support octal literals for numbers because json considers 0400 to be the decimal value 400.
in json, use decimal values for the defaultmode instead.
if you're writing yaml, you can write the defaultmode in octal.
======================================== in this exercise, you create username and password secrets  from local files.
you then create a pod that runs one container, using a projected  volume to mount the secrets into the same shared directory.
here is the configuration file for the pod: pods/storage/projected.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: test-projected-volume
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test-projected-volume
    image: busybox:1.28
    args:
    - sleep
    - ""86400""
    volumemounts:
    - name: all-in-one
      mountpath: ""/projected-volume""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: user
      - secret:
          name: pass

create the secrets:

# create files containing the username and password:
echo -n ""admin"" &gt; ./username.txt
echo -n ""1f2d1e2e67df"" &gt; ./password.txt

# package these files into secrets:
kubectl create secret generic user --from-file=./username.txt
kubectl create secret generic pass --from-file=./password.txt

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/projected.yaml

verify that the pod's container is running, and then watch for changes to the pod:

kubectl get --watch pod test-projected-volume

the output looks like this:

name                    ready     status    restarts   age
test-projected-volume   1/1       running   0          14s

in another terminal, get a shell to the running container:

kubectl exec -it test-projected-volume -- /bin/sh

in your shell, verify that the projected-volume directory contains your projected sources: ls /projected-volume/ ======================================== creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.
secret/optional-secret.yaml

kind: pod

```","1490, 1216, 484","The ""rag answer"" can be considered **incorrect**. Here are the specific points of deviation from the ""reference answer"":

1. **Resource Type**: The ""reference answer"" demonstrates the use of a `Secret` and a `Deployment` specifically for mounting secrets as files. The ""rag answer"" uses a `Deployment` but does not clearly define a `Secret` in the context of the example provided. Instead, it references a `secret` volume but does not show the creation of the `jetty-secrets` Secret, which is necessary for the deployment to function correctly.

2. **Volume Mounts**: The ""rag answer"" includes volume mounts for `config.properties` and `secrets.properties`, but it does not provide the context or content of these files. The ""reference answer"" clearly shows how to mount specific files from a Secret and provides the necessary YAML structure to do so.

3. **Namespace**: The ""rag answer"" specifies a namespace (`default`), while the ""reference answer"" does not specify a namespace. While this is not inherently incorrect, it is a deviation from the reference format.

4. **Lack of Explanation**: The ""rag answer"" does not provide any explanation or context about the purpose of the configuration, how to verify it, or how it relates to the use of Secrets and ConfigMaps, which is a key part of the ""reference answer.""

In summary, the ""rag answer"" lacks the necessary context, structure, and completeness to be considered correct in the same way as the ""reference answer."""
