    <summary>
    The user has an existing Ingress configuration that works with the deprecated API version `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`. They are attempting to update it to the newer `networking.k8s.io/v1` version but encounter validation errors related to the `backend` fields, specifically `servicename` and `serviceport`, which are not recognized in the new version. The user seeks guidance on how to properly update their Ingress configuration to the latest API version without encountering these errors.

### Explanation
I believe this pull request includes the changes you are inquiring about. The `Ingress` and `IngressClass` resources have transitioned to `networking.k8s.io/v1`. The `Ingress` and `IngressClass` types in the `extensions/v1beta1` and `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API versions are now deprecated and will not be available in version 1.22 and later. Existing objects can still be accessed through the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API. Key changes in the v1 `Ingress` objects (the field names from v1beta1 remain unchanged) include:
* `spec.backend` is now `spec.defaultBackend`
* `serviceName` is now `service.name`
* `servicePort` is now `service.port.name` (for string values)
* `servicePort` is now `service.port.number` (for numeric values)
* The `pathType` no longer has a default value in v1; you must specify ""Exact"", ""Prefix"", or ""ImplementationSpecific"".

Additional updates to the `Ingress` API include:
* Backends can now be either resource or service backends.
* The `path` is no longer required to be a valid regular expression.

If you refer to the documentation for Ingress in version 1.19, the new syntax appears to be as shown above. Unfortunately, I do not have access to a 1.19 cluster to verify this myself, but I believe this is the issue you are encountering.","to update an existing ingress to add a new host, you can update it by editing the resource:

kubectl describe ingress test

kubectl edit ingress test

this pops up an editor with the existing configuration in yaml format.
modify it to include the new host:

spec:
  rules:
  - host: foo.bar.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:

        path: /foo
        pathtype: prefix
..

after you save your changes, kubectl updates the resource in the api server, which tells the ingress controller to reconfigure the load balancer.
verify this:

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.

if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

### Explanation
You can utilize the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size` to directly set the `max-body-size` option within your Ingress resource, eliminating the need to modify a base ConfigMap. This allows for more granular control over the request body size limits for your application.","official document: for nginx, an 413 error will be returned to the client when the size in a request exceeds the maximum allowed size of the client request body. this size can be configured by the parameter [`client_max_body_size`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size).  to configure this setting globally for all ingress rules, the `proxy-body-size` value may be set in the [nginx configmap](./configmap.md#proxy-body-size). to use custom values in an ingress rule define these annotation:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 8m ``` loft blog: this rule can be used to set the maximum size of the body in a request. if the body exceeds the maximum size set, nginx will return a 413 error to the client. the body size can be configured by using the following nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioproxy-body-size 8m copy heres an example apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata name test-ingress annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioproxy-body-size 8m spec rules - http paths - path testpath backend servicename test copy","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","official document: nginx supports load balancing by client-server mapping based on [consistent hashing](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#hash) for a given key. the key can contain text, variables or any combination thereof. this feature allows for request stickiness other than client ip or cookies. the [ketama](https://www.last.fm/user/rj/journal/2007/04/10/rz_libketama_-_a_consistent_hashing_algo_for_memcache_clients) consistent hashing method will be used which ensures only a few keys would be remapped to different servers on upstream group changes.  there is a special mode of upstream hashing called subset. in this mode, upstream servers are grouped into subsets, and stickiness works by mapping keys to a subset instead of individual upstream servers. specific server is chosen uniformly at random from the selected sticky subset. it provides a balance between stickiness and load distribution.  to enable consistent hashing for a backend:  `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by`: the nginx variable, text value or any combination thereof to use for consistent hashing. for example: `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: ""$request_uri""` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: ""$request_uri$host""` or `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/upstream-hash-by: ""${request_uri}-text-value""` to consistently hash upstream requests by the current request uri.

### Explanation
For a complete overview of authentication, please consult the official Kubernetes documentation on authentication and authorization. It is advisable to use an identity provider for Kubernetes, such as OpenID Connect, for user authentication. If you are utilizing GKE or ACS, you can integrate with their respective identity and access management frameworks. For self-hosted Kubernetes setups (like those using Kops), CoreOS/Dex can be employed to connect with LDAP or OAuth2 identity providers. A detailed two-part article on SSO for Kubernetes serves as a good reference. 

Kops (version 1.10 and later) now features built-in authentication support, which simplifies the integration with AWS IAM as an identity provider for AWS users. There are also several open-source CLI clients available for Dex, such as nordstrom/kubelogin and pusher/k8s-auth-example. 

If you are seeking a quick and easy (though not the most secure or manageable in the long run) method to get started, you can utilize service accounts with two options for specialized policies to control access. It is important to note that since version 1.6, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is strongly recommended, and this response does not cover RBAC setup. 

Additionally, there is an outdated (2017-2018) guide by Bitnami on user setup with RBAC that may still be relevant. The steps to enable service account access are outlined above, and depending on your cluster configuration, these accounts may have full admin rights. A bash script is provided to automate the service account creation process. 

To control user access with policies using ABAC, you will need to create a policy file, which is also included in the above YAML. This policy should be provisioned on every master node, and the API servers should be configured with the appropriate flags to enforce the policy, granting the specified user read-only access to resources in the designated namespace.","suppose you have several clusters, and your users and components authenticate in a variety of ways.
for example: a running kubelet might authenticate using certificates.
a user might authenticate using tokens.
administrators might have sets of certificates that they provide to individual users.
with kubeconfig files, you can organize your clusters, users, and namespaces.
you can also define contexts to quickly and easily switch between clusters and namespaces.
========================================","suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for test work.
in the development cluster, your frontend developers work in a namespace called frontend, and your storage developers work in a namespace called storage.
in your test cluster, developers work in the default namespace, or they create auxiliary namespaces as they see fit.
access to the development cluster requires authentication by certificate.
access to the test cluster requires authentication by username and password.
create a directory named config-exercise.
in your config-exercise directory, create a file named config-demo with this content:

apiversion: v1
kind: config
preferences: {}

clusters:
- cluster:
  name: development
- cluster:
  name: test

users:
- name: developer
- name: experimenter

contexts:
- context:
  name: dev-frontend
- context:
  name: dev-storage
- context:
  name: exp-test

a configuration file describes clusters, users, and contexts.
your config-demo file has the framework to describe two clusters, two users, and three contexts.
go to your config-exercise directory.
enter these commands to add cluster details to your configuration file:

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster development --server=https://1.2.3.4 --certificate-authority=fake-ca-file
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster test --server=https://5.6.7.8 --insecure-skip-tls-verify

add user details to your configuration file: caution: storing passwords in kubernetes client config is risky.
a better alternative would be to use a credential plugin and store them separately.
see: client-go credential plugins 

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials developer --client-certificate=fake-cert-file --client-key=fake-key-seefile
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials experimenter --username=exp --password=some-password

note: to delete a user you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset users.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a cluster, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset clusters.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a context, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset contexts.&lt;name&gt;

add context details to your configuration file:

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-frontend --cluster=development --namespace=frontend --user=developer
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-storage --cluster=development --namespace=storage --user=developer

========================================","suppose you have several clusters, and your users and components authenticate in a variety of ways.
for example: a running kubelet might authenticate using certificates.
a user might authenticate using tokens.
administrators might have sets of certificates that they provide to individual users.
with kubeconfig files, you can organize your clusters, users, and namespaces.
you can also define contexts to quickly and easily switch between clusters and namespaces.
======================================== suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for test work.
in the development cluster, your frontend developers work in a namespace called frontend, and your storage developers work in a namespace called storage.
in your test cluster, developers work in the default namespace, or they create auxiliary namespaces as they see fit.
access to the development cluster requires authentication by certificate.
access to the test cluster requires authentication by username and password.
create a directory named config-exercise.
in your config-exercise directory, create a file named config-demo with this content:

apiversion: v1
kind: config
preferences: {}

clusters:
- cluster:
  name: development
- cluster:
  name: test

users:
- name: developer
- name: experimenter

contexts:
- context:
  name: dev-frontend
- context:
  name: dev-storage
- context:
  name: exp-test

a configuration file describes clusters, users, and contexts.
your config-demo file has the framework to describe two clusters, two users, and three contexts.
go to your config-exercise directory.
enter these commands to add cluster details to your configuration file:

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster development --server=https://1.2.3.4 --certificate-authority=fake-ca-file
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster test --server=https://5.6.7.8 --insecure-skip-tls-verify

add user details to your configuration file: caution: storing passwords in kubernetes client config is risky.
a better alternative would be to use a credential plugin and store them separately.
see: client-go credential plugins 

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials developer --client-certificate=fake-cert-file --client-key=fake-key-seefile
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials experimenter --username=exp --password=some-password

note: to delete a user you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset users.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a cluster, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset clusters.&lt;name&gt;

to remove a context, you can run

kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset contexts.&lt;name&gt;

add context details to your configuration file:

kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-frontend --cluster=development --namespace=frontend --user=developer
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-storage --cluster=development --namespace=storage --user=developer
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context exp-test --cluster=test --namespace=default --user=experimenter

open your config-demo file to see the added details.
as an alternative to opening the config-demo file, you can use the config view command.

- This is directly supported by the context, which shows the use of `kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials experimenter --username=exp --password=some-password`.  
- Fully derived.

3. Sentence:  
""Then, create a context for that user to associate them with the cluster.""

""\nRegarding the safety of sharing `cluster.certificate-authority-data`, it is generally not recommended to share sensitive data like certificate authority data unless absolutely necessary, as it can compromise the security of your cluster.""  
- The context mentions: ""caution: storing passwords in kubernetes client config is risky. a better alternative would be to use a credential plugin and store them separately.""  
- However, it does not explicitly mention the safety or risk of sharing `cluster.certificate-authority-data`. It only shows usage of `--certificate-authority=fake-ca-file` but no explicit caution about sharing certificate-authority-data.  
- So this sentence is not fully derived.

5. Sentence:  
""This recommendation aligns with best practices for Kubernetes security, which emphasize protecting sensitive information to maintain the integrity of your cluster.""  
- The context includes a caution about storing passwords and suggests credential plugins, but does not explicitly state this general recommendation or best practices about protecting sensitive information or cluster integrity.  
- So this sentence is not fully derived.

### Explanation
In Kubernetes 1.24, service account token secrets are no longer generated automatically. Refer to the ""urgent upgrade notes"" in the 1.24 changelog for more details. The `legacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate is in beta and is enabled by default. When this feature is active, secret API objects containing service account tokens will not be auto-generated for every service account. Instead, you can use the TokenRequest API to obtain service account tokens. If you require a non-expiring token, you can create a secret API object for the token controller to populate with a service account token by following the provided guide. 

This means that in Kubernetes 1.24, you will need to create the secret manually, and the token key in the data field will be set automatically for you. Since you are creating the secret manually, you will know its name and won't need to look it up in the service account object. This method should also work in earlier versions of Kubernetes.","a secret object stores sensitive data such as credentials used by pods to access services.
for example, you might need a secret to store the username and password needed to access a database.
you can create the secret by passing the raw data in the command, or by storing the credentials in files that you pass in the command.
the following commands create a secret that stores the username admin and the password s!b\*d$zdsb=.
use raw data run the following command:

kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
    --from-literal=username=admin \
    --from-literal=password='s!b\*d$zdsb='

you must use single quotes '' to escape special characters such as $, \, *, =, and ! in your strings.
if you don't, your shell will interpret these characters.
note: the stringdata field for a secret does not work well with server-side apply.
use source files store the credentials in files:

echo -n 'admin' &gt; ./username.txt
echo -n 's!b\*d$zdsb=' &gt; ./password.txt

the -n flag ensures that the generated files do not have an extra newline character at the end of the text.
this is important because when kubectl reads a file and encodes the content into a base64 string, the extra newline character gets encoded too.
you do not need to escape special characters in strings that you include in a file.
pass the file paths in the kubectl command:

kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
    --from-file=./username.txt \
    --from-file=./password.txt

the default key name is the file name.
you can optionally set the key name using --from-file=[key=]source.
for example:

kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
    --from-file=username=./username.txt \
    --from-file=password=./password.txt

with either method, the output is similar to: secret/db-user-pass created verify the secret check that the secret was created:

kubectl get secrets

the output is similar to:

name              type       data      age
db-user-pass      opaque     2         51s

view the details of the secret:

kubectl describe secret db-user-pass

the output is similar to:

type:            opaque

data
====
password:    12 bytes
username:    5 bytes

the commands kubectl get and kubectl describe avoid showing the contents of a secret by default.
this is to protect the secret from being exposed accidentally, or from being stored in a terminal log.
decode the secret view the contents of the secret you created:

kubectl get secret db-user-pass -o jsonpath='{.data}'

the output is similar to:

{ ""password"": ""uyfcxcpkjhpec2i9"", ""username"": ""ywrtaw4="" }

decode the password data:

echo 'uyfcxcpkjhpec2i9' | base64 --decode

the output is similar to: s!b\*d$zdsb= caution: this is an example for documentation purposes.
in practice, this method could cause the command with the encoded data to be stored in your shell history.
anyone with access to your computer could find the command and decode the secret.
a better approach is to combine the view and decode commands.

Explanation:
- Sentence 1: ""apiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: sa1\nsecrets:\n  - name: sa1-token""  
  This is a YAML snippet defining a ServiceAccount named ""sa1"" with a secret named ""sa1-token"".  
  The Context includes a similar example of creating a serviceaccount (build-robot) with apiVersion: v1 and kind: serviceaccount, but does not mention ""sa1"" or the ""secrets"" field with a token name. The Context does mention that serviceaccounts have secrets, but does not show this exact YAML or the secret name ""sa1-token"".  
  Since the exact YAML snippet is not present in the Context, this sentence cannot be fully derived.

- Sentence 2: ""The 'secrets' field may not be populated because the service account has not yet been used to create any pods.""  
  The Context does not explicitly state this. It mentions that serviceaccounts exist and that pods can specify serviceaccounts, but it does not say that the 'secrets' field may be empty if no pods have been created using the serviceaccount.  
  Therefore, this sentence cannot be fully derived.

- Sentence 3: ""When a pod is created that utilizes this service account, Kubernetes will automatically generate a token secret for it.""  
  The Context does not explicitly say this. It mentions serviceaccounts and secrets but does not state that creating a pod with a serviceaccount causes Kubernetes to generate a token secret automatically.  
  Therefore, this sentence cannot be fully derived.

- Sentence 4: ""To resolve this, create a pod that specifies the 'sa1' service account.""  
  The Context says you can set the spec.serviceaccountname field of a pod to the name of the serviceaccount you wish to use, but does not mention ""sa1"" or that creating a pod with the serviceaccount will resolve the missing secret issue.  
  Therefore, this sentence cannot be fully derived.

- Sentence 5: ""After doing so, you should see the associated secret listed in the 'secrets' field when you retrieve the service account information again.""  
  The Context does not mention that after creating a pod with the serviceaccount, the secret will appear in the serviceaccount's 'secrets' field.  
  Therefore, this sentence cannot be fully derived.

Hence, none of the sentences except possibly the first (which is a YAML snippet) can be fully derived. The first sentence is a direct YAML snippet, but since the exact snippet is not in the Context, it cannot be fully derived either.

However, the question is whether each sentence can be fully derived from the Context. The first sentence is a YAML snippet that is not present in the Context, so it cannot be fully derived.

Therefore, 0 sentences can be fully derived, 5 cannot.

But the example says to return [number of sentences derived, number not derived].

So the answer is [0,5].

Wait, the example says ""If Answer contains 8 sentences and 5 of them derived from the Context, you should return [5,3]"".

So in this case, 0 derived, 5 not derived.

Final answer: [0,5]"

### Explanation
I utilized `envsubst` (as detailed in the [GNU documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/envsubst-invocation.html)) to achieve this. First, create a `deployment.yaml` file with the above content. 

After that, you can set the environment variable and apply the configuration using the following commands:

```bash
export name=my-test-nginx
envsubst < deployment.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

I'm not certain which operating system you are using for this process. If you're on macOS, you can install `envsubst` with:

```bash
brew install gettext
brew link --force gettext
```","the api server sets certain fields to default values in the live configuration if they are not specified when the object is created.

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/simple_deployment.yaml

print the live configuration using kubectl get:

in a patch request, defaulted fields are not re-defaulted unless they are explicitly cleared as part of a patch request.
this can cause unexpected behavior for fields that are defaulted based on the values of other fields.
when the other fields are later changed, the values defaulted from them will not be updated unless they are explicitly cleared.
for this reason, it is recommended that certain fields defaulted by the server are explicitly defined in the configuration file, even if the desired values match the server defaults.
this makes it easier to recognize conflicting values that will not be re-defaulted by the server.

explanation: the user creates a deployment without defining

strategy.type

.
t","define and use labels  that identify semantic attributes of your application or deployment, such as

{ app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp, tier: frontend, phase: test, deployment: v3 }

.
you can use these labels to select the appropriate pods for other resources; for example, a service that selects all tier: frontend pods, or all phase: test components of

app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp

.
see the guestbook  app for examples of this approach.
a service can be made to span multiple deployments by omitting release-specific labels from its selector.
when you need to update a running service without downtime, use a deployment .
a desired state of an object is described by a deployment, and if changes to that spec are applied , the deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.
use the kubernetes common labels  for common use cases.
these standardized labels enrich the metadata in a way that allows tools, including kubectl and dashboard , to work in an interoperable way.
you can manipulate labels for debugging.
because kubernetes controllers (such as replicaset) and services match to pods using selector labels, removing the relevant labels from a pod will stop it from being considered by a controller or from being served traffic by a service.
if you remove the labels of an existing pod, its controller will create a new pod to take its place.
this is a useful way to debug a previously ""live"" pod in a ""quarantine"" environment.
to interactively remove or add labels, use kubectl label .
========================================","the following is an example of a deployment.
it creates a replicaset to bring up three nginx pods: controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml 

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerport: 80

in this example: a deployment named nginx-deployment is created, indicated by the

.metadata.name

field.
this name will become the basis for the replicasets and pods which are created later.
see writing a deployment spec  for more details.
the deployment creates a replicaset that creates three replicated pods, indicated by the

.spec.replicas

field.
the

.spec.selector

field defines how the created replicaset finds which pods to manage.
in this case, you select a label that is defined in the pod template (app: nginx).
however, more sophisticated selection rules are possible, as long as the pod template itself satisfies the rule.
note: the

.spec.selector.matchlabels

field is a map of {key,value} pairs.
a single {key,value} in the matchlabels map is equivalent to an element of matchexpressions, whose key field is ""key"", the operator is ""in"", and the values array contains only ""value"".
all of the requirements, from both matchlabels and matchexpressions, must be satisfied in order to match.
the

.spec.template

field contains the following sub-fields: the pods are labeled app: nginxusing the

.metadata.labels

field.
the pod template's specification, or

.spec

field, indicates that the pods run one container, nginx, which runs the nginx docker hub  image at version 1.14.2.
create one container and name it nginx using the

.spec.containers[0].name

field.
before you begin, make sure your kubernetes cluster is up and running.
follow the steps given below to create the above deployment: create the deployment by running the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml

run

kubectl get deployments

to check if the deployment was created.
if the deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:

name               ready   up-to-date   available   age
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s

when you inspect the deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed: name lists the names of the deployments in the namespace.
ready displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
it follows the pattern ready/desired.
up-to-date displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
available displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
age displays the amount of time that the application has been running.
notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to

.spec.replicas

field.
to see the deployment rollout status, run

kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

.
the output is similar to:

waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
deployment ""nginx-deployment"" successfully rolled out

run the

kubectl get deployments

again a few seconds later.
the output is similar to this:

name               ready   up-to-date   available   age
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           18s

notice that the deployment has created all three replicas, and all replicas are up-to-date (they contain the latest pod template) and available.
to see the replicaset (rs) created by the deployment, run

kubectl get rs

.
the output is similar to this:

name                          desired   current   ready   age
nginx-deployment-75675f5897   3         3         3       18s

replicaset output shows the following fields: name lists the names of the replicasets in the namespace.
desired displays the desired number of ","the api server sets certain fields to default values in the live configuration if they are not specified when the object is created.

The user seeks a proper method to reference global objects while iterating through a range in their Helm template.

### Explanation
When you enter a loop block in Helm templates, you lose access to the global context if you use `..`. To access the global context, you can use `$.` instead. According to the Helm documentation, there is one variable that is always global: `$`. This variable always points to the root context, which can be particularly useful when looping through a range and needing to reference the chart's release name. In your example, using this approach allows you to correctly reference the release name while iterating through the nodes.","many programming languages have support for looping using  for  loops,  foreach 
loops, or similar functional mechanisms. in helm's template language, the way to
iterate through a collection is to use the  range  operator.to start, let's add a list of pizza toppings to our  values.yaml  file:favorite : 
    drink :   coffee 
    food :   pizza 
 pizzatoppings : 
    - mushrooms 
    - cheese 
    - peppers 
    - onions 
    - pineapplenow we have a list (called a  slice  in templates) of  pizzatoppings . we can
modify our template to print this list into our configmap:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
    toppings :   |- 
     {{- range .values.pizzatoppings }}
     - {{ . | title | quote }}
     {{- end }}we can use  $  for accessing the list  values.pizzatoppings  from the parent
scope.  $  is mapped to the root scope when template execution begins and it
does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    toppings :   |- 
     {{- range $.values.pizzatoppings }}
     - {{ . | title | quote }}
     {{- end }}     
    {{- end }}let's take a closer look at the  toppings:  list. the  range  function will
""range over"" (iterate through) the  pizzatoppings  list. but now something
interesting happens. just like  with  sets the scope of  . , so does a  range 
operator. each time through the loop,  .  is set to the current pizza topping.
that is, the first time,  .  is set to  mushrooms . the second iteration it is
set to  cheese , and so on.we can send the value of  .  directly down a pipeline, so when we do  {{ . | title | quote }} , it sends  .  to  title  (title case function) and then to
 quote . if we run this template, the output will be:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml 
 apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   edgy-dragonfly-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    drink :   ""coffee"" 
    food :   ""pizza"" 
    toppings :   |- 
     - ""mushrooms""
     - ""cheese""
     - ""peppers""
     - ""onions""
     - ""pineapple""now, in this example we've done something tricky. the  toppings: |-  line is
declaring a multi-line string. so our list of toppings is actually not a yaml
list. it's a big string. why would we do this? because the data in configmaps
 data  is composed of key/value pairs, where both the key and the value are
simple strings. to understand why this is the case, take a look at the
 kubernetes configmap docs .
for us, though, this detail doesn't matter much.the  |-  marker in yaml takes a multi-line string. this can be a useful
technique for embedding big blocks of data inside of your manifests, as
exemplified here.sometimes it's useful to be able to quickly make a list inside of your template,
and then iterate over that list. helm templates have a function to make this
easy:  tuple . in computer science, a tuple is a list-like collection of fixed
size, but with arbitrary data types. this roughly conveys the way a  tuple  is
used.sizes :   |- 
     {{- range tuple ""small"" ""medium"" ""large"" }}
     - {{ . }}
     {{- end }}the above will produce this:sizes :   |- 
     - small
     - medium
     - largein addition to lists and tuples,  range  can be used to iterate over collections
that have a key and a value (like a  map  or  dict ). we'll see how to do that
in the next section when we introduce template variables.prev ← template function list next variables →","the next control structure to look at is the  with  action. this controls
variable scoping. recall that  .  is a reference to  the current scope . so
 .values  tells the template to find the  values  object in the current scope.the syntax for  with  is similar to a simple  if  statement:{{ with pipeline }}
   # restricted scope
 {{ end }}scopes can be changed.  with  can allow you to set the current scope ( . ) to a
particular object. for example, we've been working with  .values.favorite .
let's rewrite our configmap to alter the  .  scope to point to
 .values.favorite :apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }}note that we removed the  if  conditional from the previous exercise
because it is now unnecessary - the block after  with  only executes
if the value of  pipeline  is not empty.notice that now we can reference  .drink  and  .food  without qualifying them.
that is because the  with  statement sets  .  to point to  .values.favorite .
the  .  is reset to its previous scope after  {{ end }} .but here's a note of caution! inside of the restricted scope, you will not be
able to access the other objects from the parent scope using  . . this, for
example, will fail:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }} 
    {{- end }}it will produce an error because  release.name  is not inside of the restricted
scope for  . . however, if we swap the last two lines, all will work as expected
because the scope is reset after  {{ end }} .{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
    release :   {{   .release.name }}or, we can use  $  for accessing the object  release.name  from the parent
scope.  $  is mapped to the root scope when template execution begins and it
does not change during template execution. the following would work as well:{{- with .values.favorite }} 
    drink :   {{   .drink | default ""tea"" | quote }} 
    food :   {{   .food | upper | quote }} 
    release :   {{   $.release.name }} 
    {{- end }}after looking at  range , we will take a look at template variables, which offer
one solution to the scoping issue above.","say we've defined a simple template that looks like this:{{- define ""mychart.app"" -}} 
 app_name :   {{   .chart.name }} 
 app_version :   ""{{ .chart.version }}"" 
 {{- end -}}now say i want to insert this both into the  labels:  section of my template,
and also the  data:  section:apiversion :   v1 
 kind :   configmap 
 metadata : 
    name :   {{   .release.name }}-configmap 
    labels : 
      {{   template ""mychart.app"" . }} 
 data : 
    myvalue :   ""hello world"" 
    {{- range $key, $val := .values.favorite }} 
    {{   $key }} :   {{   $val | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
 {{   template ""mychart.app"" . }}if we render this, we will get an error like this:$  helm install --dry-run measly-whippet ./mychart
 error: unable to build kubernetes objects from release manifest: error validating """": error validating data: [validationerror(configmap): unknown field ""app_name"" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.configmap, validationerror(configmap): unknown field ""app_version"" in io.k8s.api.core.v1.configmap]to see what rendered, re-run with  --disable-openapi-validation :

    food :   ""pizza"" 
 app_name :   mychart 
 app_version :   ""0.1.0""note that the indentation on  app_version  is wrong in both places. why? because
the template that is substituted in has the text aligned to the left. because
 template  is an action, and not a function, there is no way to pass the output
of a  template  call to other functions; the data is simply inserted inline.to work around this case, helm provides an alternative to  template  that will
import the contents of a template into the present pipeline where it can be
passed along to other functions in the pipeline.here's the example above, corrected to use  indent  to indent the  mychart.app 
template correctly:apiversion :   v1

    {{   $key }} :   {{   $val | quote }} 
    {{- end }} 
 {{   include ""mychart.app"" . | indent 2 }}now the produced yaml is correctly indented for each section:# source: mychart/templates/configmap.yaml

    app_name :   mychart 
    app_version :   ""0.1.0""it is considered preferable to use  include  over  template  in helm templates
simply so that the output formatting can be handled better for yaml documents.sometimes we want to import content, but not as templates. that is, we want to
import files verbatim. we can achieve this by accessing files through the

### Explanation:
- The `name`, `labels`, and `image` fields should be customized to match your specific application.
- The `IP_ADDRESS` environment variable is set to the pod's IP address using `valueFrom` with `fieldRef`, which is a common practice in Kubernetes to dynamically reference the pod's own IP.
- Ensure that the `selector` matches the labels defined in the pod template to maintain proper association between the StatefulSet and its pods.","3598.0, 3597.0, 3602.0","[0,4]"

    The user is trying to configure the Nginx Ingress Controller on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and wants to know if it's possible to have the Ingress configured in one namespace (ingress-nginx) while the services it routes to are in another namespace (resources). They are encountering an error indicating that the service in the resources namespace cannot be found when the Ingress is set up in the ingress-nginx namespace.

### Explanation
Instead of creating the `Ingress` resource named `app-ingress` in the `ingress-nginx` namespace, you should create it in the same namespace where your service `api-sand` and the corresponding pod are located. Alternatively, you can achieve cross-namespace ingress by using the `ExternalName` service type. This allows you to reference a service in a different namespace. The example provided demonstrates how to set up an `ExternalName` service and an `Ingress` resource that routes traffic to it.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

        paths:

            path","ingress backed by a single service there are existing kubernetes concepts that allow you to expose a single service (see alternatives ).
you can also do this with an ingress by specifying a default backend with no rules.

  defaultbackend:
    service:
      name: test
      port:
        number: 80

if you create it using

kubectl apply -f

you should be able to view the state of the ingress you added:

kubectl get ingress test-ingress



name           class         hosts   address         ports   age
test-ingress   external-lb   *       203.0.113.123   80      59s

where

203.0.113.123

is the ip allocated by the ingress controller to satisfy this ingress.
note: ingress controllers and load balancers may take a minute or two to allocate an ip address.
until that time, you often see the address listed as <pending>.
simple fanout a fanout configuration routes traffic from a single ip address to more than one service, based on the http uri being requested.
an ingress allows you to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.
for example, a setup like:  figure.
ingress fan out it would require an ingress such as: service/networking/simple-fanout-example.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1

            name: service2
            port:

when you create the ingress with

kubectl apply -f

:

kubectl describe ingress simple-fanout-example

  normal   add     22s                loadbalancer-controller  default/test

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.
 figure.
ingress name based virtual hosting the following ingress tells the backing load balancer to route requests based on the host header .
service/networking/name-virtual-host-ingress.yaml 

apiversion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: ingress
metadata:
  name: name-virtual-host-ingress
spec:
  rules:

            name: service2
            port:
              number: 80

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.
for example, the following ingress routes traffic requested for

first.bar.com

to service1,

second.bar.com

to service2, and any traffic whose re","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code. a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

the ingress controller provisions an implementation-specific load balancer that satisfies the ingress, as long as the services (service1, service2) exist.
when it has done so, you can see the address of the load balancer at the address field.
note: depending on the ingress controller  you are using, you may need to create a default-http-backend service .
name based virtual hosting name-based virtual hosts support routing http traffic to multiple host names at the same ip address.

if you create an ingress resource without any hosts defined in the rules, then any web traffic to the ip address of your ingress controller can be matched without a name based virtual host being required.

### Explanation:
The issue arises because the Ingress resource is trying to reference a service (`api-sand`) that is located in a different namespace than the Ingress itself. In Kubernetes, Ingress resources can only route traffic to services within the same namespace unless you use a specific configuration to allow cross-namespace access. 

To fix this, ensure that the service `api-sand` is in the same namespace as the Ingress (`ingress-nginx`) or modify the Ingress to reference the correct service in its namespace. The corrected YAML above assumes the service is in the same namespace. If it is in a different namespace, you would need to create a service in the `ingress-nginx` namespace that proxies to the `api-sand` service in its original namespace.","```yaml

This adjustment will ensure that the Ingress can correctly route traffic to the intended backend service.","3397.0, 341.0, 344.0","The ""Answer"" contains 6 sentences:

1. The YAML manifest for an Ingress resource with specific fields and annotations.
2. ""The issue arises because the Ingress resource is trying to reference a service (`api-sand`) that is located in a different namespace than the Ingress itself.""
3. ""In Kubernetes, Ingress resources can only route traffic to services within the same namespace unless specific configurations are applied to allow cross-namespace access.""
4. ""To resolve this, ensure that the service `api-sand` is in the same namespace as the Ingress (`ingress-nginx`).""

6. ""This adjustment will ensure that the Ingress can correctly route traffic to the intended backend service.""

Now, let's check each sentence against the ""Context"":

1. The YAML manifest: The context contains multiple YAML examples of Ingress resources, including fields like apiVersion, kind, metadata, annotations (including rewrite-target), spec, rules, host, paths, backend service name and port. The exact YAML in the answer is not present verbatim, but all elements are consistent with the documented structure and examples. The context does not mention the namespace field in the metadata explicitly, but it is a standard Kubernetes field. The context does mention annotations like rewrite-target and ingress class nginx. So the YAML is consistent with the context and can be derived from it.

2. ""The issue arises because the Ingress resource is trying to reference a service (`api-sand`) that is located in a different namespace than the Ingress itself."" The context does not mention anything about cross-namespace service references or issues arising from that. There is no mention of namespace restrictions or errors related to referencing services in other namespaces. So this sentence cannot be derived from the context.

3. ""In Kubernetes, Ingress resources can only route traffic to services within the same namespace unless specific configurations are applied to allow cross-namespace access."" The context does not mention this limitation or any configurations for cross-namespace access. So this sentence cannot be derived from the context.

4. ""To resolve this, ensure that the service `api-sand` is in the same namespace as the Ingress (`ingress-nginx`)."" The context does not mention this resolution or namespace considerations. So this sentence cannot be derived from the context.

5. ""If the service is in a different namespace, you will need to either move the service to the `ingress-nginx` namespace or create a new service in the `ingress-nginx` namespace that proxies requests to the `api-sand` service in its original namespace."" The context does not mention this workaround or solution. So this sentence cannot be derived from the context.

6. ""This adjustment will ensure that the Ingress can correctly route traffic to the intended backend service."" This is a general statement about the effect of the previous step. Since the previous steps are not supported by the context, this cannot be derived either.

They initially created the ConfigMap using `kubectl`, but now want to define it in a `configmap.yaml` file within their Helm chart.

    }
```

### Explanation
Your `config.json` file should be located within the `mychart/` directory, not inside `mychart/templates`. The `configmap.yaml` file defines a ConfigMap that includes the contents of `config.json`. The Helm command `helm install --dry-run --debug mychart` simulates the installation of the chart, allowing you to see the rendered output. 

If you want the values in the `config.json` file to be sourced from `values.yaml`, you can modify the `configmap.yaml` as shown above. In this configuration, the keys and values from the `values.yaml` file will be dynamically inserted into the `config.json` structure. For example, if your `values.yaml` contains:
```yaml
json:
  key1: val1
  key2: val2
  key3: val3
```
The resulting ConfigMap will include these values in the `config.json` file when rendered.","say we've defined a simple template that looks like this:{{- define ""mychart.app"" -}}

### Explanation
It appears that your JSON override is incorrectly specified. Unfortunately, the `kubectl run` command will simply ignore any fields it does not recognize. To troubleshoot this issue, I executed the command you provided and then, in a separate terminal, ran:

```bash
kubectl get job ubuntu -o json
```

This allowed me to observe that the actual job structure differs from your JSON override. Specifically, you were missing the nested `template/spec`, and the `volumes`, `volumeMounts`, and `containers` fields need to be defined as arrays.","in this exercise, you create a pod that runs one container.
this pod has a volume of type emptydir  that lasts for the life of the pod, even if the container terminates and restarts.
here is the configuration file for the pod: pods/storage/redis.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - name: redis
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: redis-storage
      mountpath: /data/redis
  volumes:
  - name: redis-storage
    emptydir: {}

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/redis.yaml

verify that the pod's container is running, and then watch for changes to the pod:

kubectl get pod redis --watch

the output looks like this:

name      ready     status    restarts   age
redis     1/1       running   0          13s

in another terminal, get a shell to the running container:

kubectl exec -it redis -- /bin/bash

in your shell, go to /data/redis, and then create a file:

root@redis:/data# cd /data/redis/
root@redis:/data/redis# echo hello &gt; test-file

in your shell, list the running processes:

root@redis:/data/redis# apt-get update
root@redis:/data/redis# apt-get install procps
root@redis:/data/redis# ps aux

the output is similar to this:

user       pid %cpu %mem    vsz   rss tty      stat start   time command
redis        1  0.1  0.1  33308  3828 ?        ssl  00:46   0:00 redis-server *:6379
root        12  0.0  0.0  20228  3020 ?        ss   00:47   0:00 /bin/bash
root        15  0.0  0.0  17500  2072 ?        r+   00:48   0:00 ps aux

in your shell, kill the redis process:

root@redis:/data/redis# kill &lt;pid&gt;

where <pid> is the redis process id (pid).
in your original terminal, watch for changes to the redis pod.
eventually, you will see something like this:

name      ready     status     restarts   age
redis     1/1       running    0          13s
redis     0/1       completed  0         6m
redis     1/1       running    1         6m

at this point, the container has terminated and restarted.
this is because the redis pod has a restartpolicy  of always.
get a shell into the restarted container:

kubectl exec -it redis -- /bin/bash

in your shell, go to /data/redis, and verify that test-file is still there.

root@redis:/data/redis# cd /data/redis/
root@redis:/data/redis# ls
test-file

delete the pod that you created for this exercise:

kubectl delete pod redis

========================================","when you create a pod, you can define a command and arguments for the containers that run in the pod.
to define a command, include the command field in the configuration file.
to define arguments for the command, include the args field in the configuration file.
the command and arguments that you define cannot be changed after the pod is created.
the command and arguments that you define in the configuration file override the default command and arguments provided by the container image.
if you define args, but do not define a command, the default command is used with your new arguments.
note: the command field corresponds to entrypoint, and the args field corresponds to cmd in some container runtimes.
in this exercise, you create a pod that runs one container.
the configuration file for the pod defines a command and two arguments: pods/commands.yaml

  containers:
  - name: command-demo-container
    image: debian
    command: [""printenv""]
    args: [""hostname"", ""kubernetes_port""]
  restartpolicy: onfailure

create a pod based on the yaml configuration file:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/commands.yaml

list the running pods:

kubectl get pods

the output shows that the container that ran in the command-demo pod has completed.
to see the output of the command that ran in the container, view the logs from the pod:

kubectl logs command-demo

the output shows the values of the hostname and kubernetes_port environment variables:

command-demo
tcp://10.3.240.1:443

attach to the container:

kubectl attach -it image-volume bash

### Explanation
If your GKE project is named `my-gke` and the project containing the services that your GKE containers need to access is `my-data`, one way to set this up is as follows:

1. Create a service account in the `my-data` project and assign it the necessary GCP roles/permissions (for example, `roles/bigquery.dataviewer` if your GKE containers need to read from BigQuery tables).

2. Generate a service account key for that service account. When you do this in the Google Cloud Console, following the instructions at https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys, a JSON file containing the service account credentials will be automatically downloaded.

3. Create a Kubernetes Secret resource to store those service account credentials. The YAML snippet above illustrates how this might look.

4. Mount the credentials in the container that requires access. You can specify the volume and volume mount in your pod specification.

5. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in the container to point to the path of the mounted credentials file.

With this setup, any official GCP clients (such as the GCP Python client, GCP Java client, or the gcloud CLI) will recognize the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and use the credentials of the service account you created when making API requests.","this example illustrates a pod which consumes a secret containing production credentials and another pod which consumes a secret with test environment credentials.
create a secret for prod environment credentials:

kubectl create secret generic prod-db-secret --from-literal=username=produser --from-literal=password=y4nys7f11

the output is similar to:

secret ""prod-db-secret"" created

create a secret for test environment credentials.

kubectl create secret generic test-db-secret --from-literal=username=testuser --from-literal=password=iluvtests

the output is similar to:

secret ""test-db-secret"" created

note: special characters such as $, \, *, =, and ! will be interpreted by your shell  and require escaping.
in most shells, the easiest way to escape the password is to surround it with single quotes (').
for example, if your actual password is s!b\*d$zdsb=, you should execute the command as follows:

kubectl create secret generic dev-db-secret --from-literal=username=devuser --from-literal=password='s!b\*d$zdsb='

you do not need to escape special characters in passwords from files (--from-file).
create the pod manifests:

eof

note: how the specs for the two pods differ only in one field; this facilitates creating pods with different capabilities from a common pod template.
apply all those objects on the api server by running:

kubectl create -f pod.yaml

both containers will have the following files present on their filesystems with the values for each container's environment: /etc/secret-volume/username /etc/secret-volume/password you could further simplify the base pod specification by using two service accounts: prod-user with the prod-db-secret test-user with the test-db-secret the pod specification is shortened to:

references secret  volume  pod  ========================================","you can use secrets for purposes such as the following: set environment variables for a container .
provide credentials such as ssh keys or passwords to pods .
allow the kubelet to pull container images from private registries .
the kubernetes control plane also uses secrets; for example, bootstrap token secrets  are a mechanism to help automate node registration.
use case: dotfiles in a secret volume you can make your data ""hidden"" by defining a key that begins with a dot.
this key represents a dotfile or ""hidden"" file.
for example, when the following secret is mounted into a volume, secret-volume, the volume will contain a single file, called

.secret-file

, and the dotfile-test-container will have this file present at the path

/etc/secret-volume/.secret-file

.
note: files beginning with dot characters are hidden from the output of ls -l; you must use ls -la to see them when listing directory contents.

use case: secret visible to one container in a pod consider a program that needs to handle http requests, do some complex business logic, and then sign some messages with an hmac.
because it has complex application logic, there might be an unnoticed remote file reading exploit in the server, which could expose the private key to an attacker.
this could be divided into two processes in two containers: a frontend container which handles user interaction and business logic, but which cannot see the private key; and a signer container that can see the private key, and responds to simple signing requests from the frontend (for example, over localhost networking).
with this partitioned approach, an attacker now has to trick the application server into doing something rather arbitrary, which may be harder than getting it to read a file.
alternatives to secrets rather than using a secret to protect confidential data, you can pick from alternatives.
here are some of your options: if your cloud-native component needs to authenticate to another application that you know is running within the same kubernetes cluster, you can use a serviceaccount  and its tokens to identify your client.
there are third-party tools that you can run, either within or outside your cluster, that manage sensitive data.
for example, a service that pods access over https, that reveals a secret if the client correctly authenticates (for example, with a serviceaccount token).
for authentication, you can implement a custom signer for x.509 certificates, and use certificatesigningrequests  to let that custom signer issue certificates to pods that need them.
you can use a device plugin  to expose node-local encryption hardware to a specific pod.
for example, you can schedule trusted pods onto nodes that provide a trusted platform module, configured out-of-band.
you can also combine two or more of those options, including the option to use secret objects themselves.
for example: implement (or deploy) an operator  that fetches short-lived session tokens from an external service, and then creates secrets based on those short-lived session tokens.
pods running in your cluster can make use of the session tokens, and operator ensures they are valid.
this separation means that you can run pods that are unaware of the exact mechanisms for issuing and refreshing those session tokens.
========================================","in this exercise, you create username and password secrets  from local files.
you then create a pod that runs one container, using a projected  volume to mount the secrets into the same shared directory.
here is the configuration file for the pod: pods/storage/projected.yaml

create the secrets:

# create files containing the username and password:
echo -n ""admin"" &gt; ./username.txt
echo -n ""1f2d1e2e67df"" &gt; ./password.txt

# package these files into secrets:
kubectl create secret generic user --from-file=./username.txt
kubectl create secret generic pass --from-file=./password.txt

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/storage/projected.yaml

verify that the pod's container is running, and then watch for changes to the pod:

kubectl get --watch pod test-projected-volume

the output looks like this:

name                    ready     status    restarts   age
test-projected-volume   1/1       running   0          14s

in another terminal, get a shell to the running container:

kubectl exec -it test-projected-volume -- /bin/sh

in your shell, verify that the projected-volume directory contains your projected sources: ls /projected-volume/ ========================================","this example illustrates a pod which consumes a secret containing production credentials and another pod which consumes a secret with test environment credentials.

Explanation:
There are 5 sentences in the ""Answer"":

1. The first sentence is a multi-line code block with comments and commands about removing Tiller initialization, using Helm 3 commands, checking Helm version, adding the stable repo with --force-update, and installing a chart.  
   - The ""Context"" mentions the deprecation of the old stable repo, the need to update the repo URL to https://charts.helm.sh/stable with --force-update, and that Helm 3 no longer uses Tiller.  
   - It also mentions ""you no longer need to initialize helm"" and ""helm init removed,"" which implies removing Tiller initialization.  
   - The commands `helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable --force-update` and `helm install <release-name> <chart-name> --namespace <namespace>` align with the context.  
   Therefore, this sentence can be fully derived from the context.

2. ""The error you encountered is due to the fact that Tiller is no longer used in Helm 3, which is the version you should be using.""  
   - The context states ""this command does not exist in helm 3, following the removal of tiller"" and ""you no longer need to install tiller,"" indicating Tiller is removed in Helm 3.  
   - It also implies Helm 3 is the current version to use.  
   So this sentence can be derived from the context.

3. ""Helm 3 operates without Tiller, and you should directly install charts using the `helm install` command.""  
   - The context says ""no longer need to initialize helm,"" ""helm init removed,"" and ""helm install/set-up is simplified: helm client only (no tiller).""  
   - It also shows usage of `helm install` command.  
   So this sentence can be derived from the context.

4. ""Make sure to add the stable repository and install your desired chart accordingly.""  
   - The context discusses the stable repo deprecation and the need to add the stable repo with the new URL and --force-update flag.  
   - However, the context does not explicitly say ""Make sure to add the stable repository and install your desired chart accordingly"" as a direct instruction or recommendation.  
   - It implies it, but the exact sentence or full derivation is not present.  
   So this sentence cannot be fully derived.

5. ""This approach aligns with the current best practices for using Helm in Kubernetes environments.""  
   - The context does not explicitly mention ""best practices"" or that this approach aligns with them.  
   - It is an interpretative or evaluative statement, not directly supported by the context.  
   So this sentence cannot be fully derived.

Hence, 3 sentences can be fully derived, and 2 cannot."

### Explanation
For Kubernetes version 1.19.x, you should specify `batch/v1beta1` as the `apiVersion` for your CronJob. This is outlined in the documentation for version 1.19, which can be found at: https://v1-19.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/. The CronJob resource only reached stable status in Kubernetes version 1.21.","cronjob represents the configuration of a single cron job.

run the example cronjob by using this command:

kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/job/cronjob.yaml

the output is similar to this:

cronjob.batch/hello created

after creating the cron job, get its status using this command:

kubectl get cronjob hello

the output is similar to this:

hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        &lt;none&gt;          10s

as you can see from the results of the command, the cron job has not scheduled or run any jobs yet.
watch  for the job to be created in around one minute:

kubectl get jobs --watch

the output is similar to this:

now you've seen one running job scheduled by the ""hello"" cron job.
you can stop watching the job and view the cron job again to see that it scheduled the job:

kubectl get cronjob hello

hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        50s             75s

you should see that the cron job hello successfully scheduled a job at the time specified in last schedule.
there are currently 0 active jobs, meaning that the job has completed or failed.
now, find the pods that the last scheduled job created and view the standard output of one of the pods.

30538210,how to mimic '--volumes-from' in kubernetes,"<rewrite question>
    <classification>
    The question is about ""Kubernetes volumes and sharing data between containers"".
    </classification>
    <summary>
    The user is seeking a method to share a directory between two containers running in the same Kubernetes pod. They have a Ruby on Rails application that contains static assets in a specific directory, which they need to access from an Nginx container. The user attempted to use a hostPath volume to share the directory but found that it was empty. They are looking for a way to mimic Docker's `--volumes-from` functionality in Kubernetes or an alternative method to share files between the two containers.

### Explanation
In the latest Kubernetes release, you can utilize a feature called initContainers to manage the order of container initialization, which replaces the need for the postStart lifecycle hook mentioned in my previous response. The initContainer will ensure that the necessary files are copied before the main application container starts. 

Please note that initContainers are still considered a beta feature, and you can refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more details on handling initialization: [Kubernetes Init Containers](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/production-pods/#handling-initialization).","in this part of exercise, you create a pod that has one container, and you project pod-level fields into the running container as files.
here is the manifest for the pod: pods/inject/dapi-volume.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-downwardapi-volume-example
  labels:
    zone: us-est-coast
    cluster: test-cluster1

      command: [""sh"", ""-c""]
      args:
      - while true; do
          if [[ -e /etc/podinfo/labels ]]; then
            echo -en '\n\n'; cat /etc/podinfo/labels; fi;
          if [[ -e /etc/podinfo/annotations ]]; then
            echo -en '\n\n'; cat /etc/podinfo/annotations; fi;
          sleep 5;
        done;
      volumemounts:
        - name: podinfo
          mountpath: /etc/podinfo
  volumes:
    - name: podinfo
      downwardapi:
        items:
          - path: ""labels""
            fieldref:
              fieldpath: metadata.labels
          - path: ""annotations""
            fieldref:
              fieldpath: metadata.annotations

in the manifest, you can see that the pod has a downwardapi volume, and the container mounts the volume at /etc/podinfo.
look at the items array under downwardapi.
each element of the array defines a downwardapi volume.
the first element specifies that the value of the pod's

metadata.labels

field should be stored in a file named labels.
the second element specifies that the value of the pod's annotations field should be stored in a file named annotations.
note: the fields in this example are pod fields.
they are not fields of the container in the pod.
create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/dapi-volume.yaml

verify that the container in the pod is running:

kubectl get pods

view the container's logs:

kubectl logs kubernetes-downwardapi-volume-example

the output shows the contents of the labels file and the annotations file:

cluster=""test-cluster1""
rack=""rack-22""
zone=""us-est-coast""

build=""two""
builder=""john-doe""

get a shell into the container that is running in your pod:

kubectl exec -it kubernetes-downwardapi-volume-example -- sh

in your shell, view the labels file:

/# cat /etc/podinfo/labels

the output shows that all of the pod's labels have been written to the labels file:

cluster=""test-cluster1""
rack=""rack-22""
zone=""us-est-coast""

similarly, view the annotations file:

/# cat /etc/podinfo/annotations

view the files in the /etc/podinfo directory:

/# ls -lar /etc/podinfo

in the output, you can see that the labels and annotations files are in a temporary subdirectory: in this example,

..2982_06_02_21_47_53.299460680

.
in the /etc/podinfo directory,

..data

is a symbolic link to the temporary subdirectory.
also in the /etc/podinfo directory, labels and annotations are symbolic links.

using symbolic links enables dynamic atomic refresh of the metadata; updates are written to a new temporary directory, and the

..data

symlink is updated atomically using rename(2) .
note: a container using downward api as a subpath  volume mount will not receive downward api updates.

in the configuration file, you can see that the pod has a volume named shared-data.
the first container listed in the configuration file runs an nginx server.
the mount path for the shared volume is /usr/share/nginx/html.
the second container is based on the debian image, and has a mount path of /pod-data.
the second container runs the following command and then terminates.

echo hello from the debian container &gt; /pod-data/index.html

notice that the second container writes the

index.html

file in the root directory of the nginx server.
create the pod and the two containers:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/two-container-pod.yaml

in your shell, verify that nginx is running:

root@two-containers:/# apt-get update

recall that the debian container created the

index.html

file in the nginx root directory.
use curl to send a get request to the nginx server:

1. The YAML snippet with two containers, volumeMounts, and an emptyDir volume.
2. Explanation about using emptyDir instead of hostPath for data persistence and security.
3. Statement that both containers share a temporary directory created when the pod starts.
4. Statement that data written by one container is accessible to the other, mimicking Docker's --volumes-from, with ephemeral data scoped to pod lifecycle.

Now, check if each sentence can be fully derived from the ""Context"":

1. YAML snippet:

- The context includes a pod with two containers (nginx and debian) sharing a volume named shared-data with emptyDir: {}.
- The mountPaths differ from the Answer's snippet (/usr/share/nginx/html and /pod-data in context vs /app/<app-name>/public and /var/www/html in Answer).
- The Answer's snippet uses volume name ""assets"" while context uses ""shared-data"".
- The Answer's snippet has two containers: one with image <app-image> and name <app-name>, the other nginx.
- The context has nginx and debian containers.
- The Answer's snippet mounts the volume ""assets"" readOnly: true in nginx container; context does not mention readOnly.
- The Answer's snippet uses volumeMounts and volumes keys with emptyDir: {}.

Conclusion: The exact YAML snippet in the Answer is not present in the Context. The Context has a similar example but with different container names, images, mountPaths, and volume names. So this sentence cannot be fully derived.

2. Explanation about using emptyDir instead of hostPath for data persistence and security:

- The Context does not mention hostPath volumes or discuss their issues.
- The Context only shows emptyDir usage for sharing data between containers.
- The explanation about hostPath and emptyDir is not present in the Context.

Conclusion: This sentence cannot be fully derived.

3. Statement that both containers share a temporary directory created when the pod starts:

- The Context explicitly states that the pod has a volume named shared-data with emptyDir: {}.
- It says the two containers mount this volume at different paths.
- It says the volume is temporary and shared.
- So this sentence is supported by the Context.

Conclusion: This sentence can be fully derived.

4. Statement that data written by one container is accessible to the other, mimicking Docker's --volumes-from, with ephemeral data scoped to pod lifecycle:

- The Context shows the debian container writing index.html to the shared volume.
- The nginx container serves that file.
- This mimics Docker's --volumes-from functionality.
- The volume is emptyDir, so ephemeral and scoped to pod lifecycle.
- The Context does not explicitly mention Docker's --volumes-from, but the behavior is described.

Conclusion: The sentence is mostly supported by the Context, except the explicit mention of Docker's --volumes-from is not in the Context. However, the behavior is described.

Given the instruction is ""whether each sentence can be fully derived,"" the explicit mention of Docker's --volumes-from is not in the Context, so this sentence cannot be fully derived.

Summary:

- Sentence 1: Cannot be fully derived (YAML differs).
- Sentence 2: Cannot be fully derived (no mention of hostPath or explanation).
- Sentence 3: Can be fully derived.
- Sentence 4: Cannot be fully derived (explicit Docker mention missing).

### Explanation
I have reviewed your issue and reached the following conclusions: The ingress will function correctly, and the warnings you are encountering are merely notifications regarding the available API versioning. There is no need for concern about this. I have observed similar warnings:

```
@microk8s:~$ kubectl describe ing
warning: extensions/v1beta1 ingress is deprecated in v1.14+, unavailable in v1.22+; use networking.k8s.io/v1 ingress
```

Regarding the reason for these warnings appearing even when you specify `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1`, here’s the explanation: This behavior is expected. When you create an ingress object, it can be accessed through any version, as the server manages the conversion to the requested version. The command `kubectl get ingress` is ambiguous because it does not specify which version you want to retrieve. In such cases, `kubectl` consults the discovery documents provided by the server to find the first group/version that includes the specified resource.

Historically, for compatibility reasons, `extensions/v1beta1` has been favored over other API versions. Now that ingress is the only resource left in that group, and since it has a GA replacement, version 1.20 will lower its priority so that `kubectl get ingress` will read from `networking.k8s.io/v1`. However, a server running version 1.19 will still adhere to the historical priority.

If you wish to retrieve a specific version, you can qualify the get request (e.g., `kubectl get ingresses.v1.networking.k8s.io ...`) or provide a manifest file to request the same version specified in the file (e.g., `kubectl get -f ing.yaml -o yaml`).

In summary, even though you are using the correct `apiVersion`, the deprecated version is still treated as the default, which is why you are seeing the warning. Additionally, I have noticed that changes are still being made, indicating ongoing work in this area.","official document: in some scenarios the exposed url in the backend service differs from the specified path in the ingress rule. without a rewrite any request will return 404. set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` to the path expected by the service.  if the application root is exposed in a different path and needs to be redirected, set the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root` to redirect requests for `/`.  !!! example     please check the [rewrite](../../examples/rewrite/readme.md) example. github pages: this example demonstrates how to use rewrite annotations. prerequisites you will need to make sure your ingress targets exactly one ingress controller by specifying the ingress.class annotation, and that you have an ingress controller running in your cluster. deployment rewriting can be controlled using the following annotations name description values nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target target uri where the traffic must be redirected string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iossl-redirect indicates if the location section is only accessible via ssl defaults to true when ingress contains a certificate bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioforce-ssl-redirect forces the redirection to https even if the ingress is not tls enabled bool nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root defines the application root that the controller must redirect if its in context string nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex indicates if the paths defined on an ingress use regular expressions bool. create an ingress rule with a rewrite annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iouse-regex true nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target 2 name rewrite namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host rewrite.bar.com http paths - path something. pathtype implementationspecific backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - in this ingress definition, any characters captured by . will be assigned to the placeholder 2, which is then used as a parameter in the rewrite-target annotation. for example, the ingress definition above will result in the following rewrites rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomething rewrites to rewrite.bar.com rewrite.bar.comsomethingnew rewrites to rewrite.bar.comnew app root create an ingress rule with an app-root annotation echo apiversion networking.k8s.iov1 kind ingress metadata annotations nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioapp-root app1 name approot namespace default spec ingressclassname nginx rules - host approot.bar.com http paths - path pathtype prefix backend service name http-svc port number 80 kubectl create -f - check the rewrite is working curl -i -k httpapproot.bar.com http1.1 302 moved temporarily server nginx1.11.10 date mon, 13 mar 2017 145715 gmt content-type texthtml content-length 162 location httpapproot.bar.comapp1 connection keep-alive. medium website: example 1 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target destination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one does a transparent reverse proxy. it does not update the location header so the url in the browser does not change. example 2 apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.iorewrite-target httpsnginx.redirectdestination12 name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source. this one changes the location header and the url in the browser is updated http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsource location httpsnginx.redirectdestination http1.1 302 moved temporarily curl -i httpnginx.redirectsourcebar location httpsnginx.redirectdestinationbar this is because the replacement string as specified in rewrite-target an","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

Now, check if each sentence can be fully derived from the ""Context"":

1. The YAML manifest:

- The context includes multiple examples of ingress manifests, including one minimal ingress manifest with `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1`, `kind: ingress`, metadata name, spec with `ingressClassName` (note: in the context it is sometimes written as `ingressclassname` or `ingress.class` or `ingressClassName`), rules, host, path, pathType, backend service name and port number.

- The context mentions that `ingressClassName` should be specified to avoid deprecation warnings.

- The context mentions that `pathType` should be `Prefix` instead of `ImplementationSpecific` for better compatibility.

- The exact host `cheddar.213.215.191.78.nip.io` is not mentioned in the context, but the context shows examples with hosts like `rewrite.bar.com`, `approot.bar.com`, `nginx.redirect`, etc.

- The exact YAML snippet in the answer is not present in the context, but the structure and fields are consistent with the context's examples and recommendations.

- The comment lines in the YAML in the answer (""# Specify the ingress class to avoid deprecation warnings"", ""# Use Prefix instead of ImplementationSpecific for better compatibility"") are not in the context but are reasonable explanations derived from the context.

- Since the question is whether the sentence can be fully derived from the context, the exact YAML with the exact host is not present, but the structure and rationale are.

- The question is about ""fully derived"" - the exact YAML is not fully present, but the structure and rationale are.

- Given that the context does not mention the exact host or the exact YAML, but the structure and rationale are present, this sentence cannot be fully derived from the context.

2. ""The warnings about deprecated API versions are likely due to the absence of an `ingressClassName` field and the use of `ImplementationSpecific` for `pathType`.""

- The context mentions that specifying `ingressClassName` avoids deprecation warnings.

- The context mentions that `ImplementationSpecific` for `pathType` is deprecated or less compatible, recommending `Prefix`.

- So this explanation is supported by the context.

- Therefore, this sentence can be fully derived from the context.

3. ""Specifying `ingressClassName` ensures that the Ingress resource is associated with the correct Ingress controller, and using `Prefix` for `pathType` is more standard and widely supported.""

- The context states that specifying `ingressClassName` ensures the ingress targets exactly one ingress controller.

- The context recommends using `Prefix` instead of `ImplementationSpecific` for better compatibility.

- So this sentence is supported by the context.

- Therefore, this sentence can be fully derived from the context.

### Explanation
I appreciate Peter for pointing out that the idea was fundamentally sound, which led me to discover the missing link. Since a ServiceMonitor is designed to monitor services, I overlooked the necessity of creating a service, which is not included in the GitLab Helm chart. Ultimately, this YAML configuration resolved the issue for me, and the metrics are now visible in Prometheus. 

It's worth noting that the target port for metrics is specified in the GitLab Runner chart.","to deploy a prometheus scraper to consistently scrape the metrics, use the following configuration:

for your amazon eks cluster, the core kubernetes control plane metrics are also ingested into amazon cloudwatch metrics under the aws/eks namespace.
to view them, open the cloudwatch console and select all metrics from the left navigation pane.
on the metrics selection page, choose the aws/eks namespace and a metrics dimension for your cluster.
========================================","the first step in troubleshooting is triage.
what is the problem? is it your pods, your replication controller or your service? debugging pods  debugging replication controllers  debugging services  debugging pods the first step in debugging a pod is taking a look at it.
check the current state of the pod and recent events with the following command:

kubectl describe pods ${pod_name}

look at the state of the containers in the pod.
are they all running? have there been recent restarts? continue debugging depending on the state of the pods.
my pod stays pending if a pod is stuck in pending it means that it can not be scheduled onto a node.
generally this is because there are insufficient resources of one type or another that prevent scheduling.
look at the output of the

kubectl describe ...

command above.
there should be messages from the scheduler about why it can not schedule your pod.
reasons include: you don't have enough resources : you may have exhausted the supply of cpu or memory in your cluster, in this case you need to delete pods, adjust resource requests, or add new nodes to your cluster.
see compute resources document  for more information.
you are using hostport : when you bind a pod to a hostport there are a limited number of places that pod can be scheduled.
in most cases, hostport is unnecessary, try using a service object to expose your pod.
if you do require hostport then you can only schedule as many pods as there are nodes in your kubernetes cluster.
my pod stays waiting if a pod is stuck in the waiting state, then it has been scheduled to a worker node, but it can't run on that machine.
again, the information from

kubectl describe ...

should be informative.
the most common cause of waiting pods is a failure to pull the image.
there are three things to check: make sure that you have the name of the image correct.
have you pushed the image to the registry? try to manually pull the image to see if the image can be pulled.
for example, if you use docker on your pc, run

docker pull &lt;image&gt;

.
my pod stays terminating if a pod is stuck in the terminating state, it means that a deletion has been issued for the pod, but the control plane is unable to delete the pod object.
this typically happens if the pod has a finalizer  and there is an admission webhook  installed in the cluster that prevents the control plane from removing the finalizer.
to identify this scenario, check if your cluster has any validatingwebhookconfiguration or mutatingwebhookconfiguration that target update operations for pods resources.
if the webhook is provided by a third-party: make sure you are using the latest version.
disable the webhook for update operations.
report an issue with the corresponding provider.
if you are the author of the webhook: for a mutating webhook, make sure it never changes immutable fields on update operations.
for example, changes to containers are usually not allowed.
for a validating webhook, make sure that your validation policies only apply to new changes.
in other words, you should allow pods with existing violations to pass validation.
this allows pods that were created before the validating webhook was installed to continue running.
my pod is crashing or otherwise unhealthy once your pod has been scheduled, the methods described in debug running pods  are available for debugging.
my pod is running but not doing what i told it to do if your pod is not behaving as you expected, it may be that there was an error in your pod description (e.g.

mypod.yaml

file on your local machine), and that the error was silently ignored when you created the pod.
often a section of the pod description is nested incorrectly, or a key name is typed incorrectly, and so the key is ignored.
for example, if you misspelled command as commnd then the pod will be created but will not use the command line you intended it to use.
the first thing to do is to delete your pod and try creating it again with the --validate option.
for example, run

kubectl apply --va","a service is an object  (the same way that a pod or a configmap is an object).
you can create, view or modify service definitions using the kubernetes api.
usually you use a tool such as kubectl to make those api calls for you.
for example, suppose you have a set of pods that each listen on tcp port 9376 and are labelled as

app.kubernetes.io/name=myapp

.
you can define a service to publish that tcp listener: service/simple-service.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: tcp
      port: 80
      targetport: 9376

applying this manifest creates a new service named ""my-service"" with the default clusterip service type .
the service targets tcp port 9376 on any pod with the

app.kubernetes.io/name: myapp

label.
kubernetes assigns this service an ip address (the cluster ip ), that is used by the virtual ip address mechanism.
for more details on that mechanism, read virtual ips and service proxies .
the controller for that service continuously scans for pods that match its selector, and then makes any necessary updates to the set of endpointslices for the service.
the name of a service object must be a valid rfc 1035 label name .
note: a service can map any incoming port to a targetport.
by default and for convenience, the targetport is set to the same value as the port field.
port definitions port definitions in pods have names, and you can reference these names in the targetport attribute of a service.
for example, we can bind the targetport of the service to the pod port in the following way:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - containerport: 80
        name: http-web-svc

---
apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
  ports:
  - name: name-of-service-port
    protocol: tcp
    port: 80
    targetport: http-web-svc

this works even if there is a mixture of pods in the service using a single configured name, with the same network protocol available via different port numbers.
this offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving your services.
for example, you can change the port numbers that pods expose in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.
the default protocol for services is tcp ; you can also use any other supported protocol .
because many services need to expose more than one port, kubernetes supports multiple port definitions  for a single service.
each port definition can have the same protocol, or a different one.
services without selectors services most commonly abstract access to kubernetes pods thanks to the selector, but when used with a corresponding set of endpointslices  objects and without a selector, the service can abstract other kinds of backends, including ones that run outside the cluster.
for example: you want to have an external database cluster in production, but in your test environment you use your own databases.
you want to point your service to a service in a different namespace  or on another cluster.
you are migrating a workload to kubernetes.
while evaluating the approach, you run only a portion of your backends in kubernetes.
in any of these scenarios you can define a service without specifying a selector to match pods.
for example:

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: tcp
      port: 80
      targetport: 9376

because this service has no selector, the corresponding endpointslice (and legacy endpoints) objects are not created automatically.
you can map the service to the network address and port where it's running, by adding an endpointslice object manually.
for example:

apiversion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: endpointslice
metadata:
  name: my-service-1 # by convention, use the name ","to deploy a prometheus scraper to consistently scrape the metrics, use the following configuration:

- The ""Context"" does not mention ServiceMonitor or any YAML configuration for monitoring.coreos.com/v1 or GitLab Runner.
- The ""Context"" includes Prometheus configuration but in a ConfigMap format, not ServiceMonitor.
- The ""Context"" does not mention labels like 'app: gitlab-runner-gitlab-runner' or 'release: prometheus'.
- The ""Context"" does not mention 'http-metrics' port or interval 15s.
=> This sentence cannot be fully derived from the Context.

2. '1.' - just a number, no content to verify.

3. '**Namespace**: Ensure the `namespace` in the ServiceMonitor matches the namespace where your Prometheus instance is deployed.'

- The Context mentions namespaces in various places but does not mention ServiceMonitor or the need to match namespace of ServiceMonitor to Prometheus.
- No explicit instruction about namespace matching for ServiceMonitor.

5. '**Selector**: The `matchLabels` in the `selector` should correctly match the labels of the GitLab Runner pods.'

- The Context mentions selectors in services and pods, but no mention of GitLab Runner pods or matchLabels for them.

### Explanation
To resolve the error `error: unable to recognize ""ingress.yaml"": no matches for kind ""ingress"" in version ""extensions/v1beta1""`, you need to update the `apiVersion` to `networking.k8s.io/v1`. The `networkpolicy` resource in the `extensions/v1beta1` API version is no longer supported, and you should migrate to the `networking.k8s.io/v1` API version, which has been available since v1.8. Existing persisted data can still be accessed and modified using the new version.

For the second issue, you need to make several adjustments to your Ingress definition to ensure the Kubernetes dashboard is properly exposed on the MicroK8s cluster:

1. Add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2`.
2. Include the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | rewrite ^(/dashboard)$ $1/ redirect;`.
3. Change the path from `path: /dashboard` to `path: /dashboard(/|$)(.*)`.

These changes are necessary to correctly forward requests to the backend pods. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation modifies the URL before it reaches the backend pods. In the path `/dashboard(/|$)(.*)`, the `(.*)` captures the dynamic URL generated when accessing the Kubernetes dashboard. The rewrite target annotation replaces this captured data in the URL before sending the request to the `kubernetes-dashboard` service. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet` annotation ensures that a trailing slash (`/`) is added only when accessing `alb-url/dashboard`.

Additionally, you need to make two more changes:

1. Add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""https""` to instruct the NGINX Ingress to communicate with the dashboard service over HTTPS.
2. Include the annotation `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: public` to specify the use of the NGINX Ingress created by the MicroK8s Ingress plugin.

After implementing all the above changes, the final YAML configuration should work correctly without needing to run the MicroK8s proxy command.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source? httpsnginx.redirectdestination1 permanent name destination-home namespace mynamespace spec rules - host nginx.redirect http paths - backend servicename http-svc serviceport 80 path source this one looks like it gives the greatest control over the redirectrewrite as it will add the additional configuration snippet to the resulting nginx.conf location. permanent returns a permanent redirect with the 301 code.","a minimal ingress resource example: service/networking/minimal-ingress.yaml

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

   - kind: Ingress
   - metadata including name: dashboard, namespace: kube-system, annotations for ingress class nginx and backend protocol HTTPS
   - spec with rules for path /dashboard pointing to service kubernetes-dashboard on port 443

   The ""Context"" contains multiple examples of Ingress manifests, including the correct apiVersion networking.k8s.io/v1, kind Ingress, metadata with annotations including kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx, and backend service specification with service name and port number. However, the exact example with namespace kube-system, name dashboard, and annotation nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""HTTPS"" is not explicitly present in the ""Context"". The ""Context"" mentions the use of ingress class nginx and correct apiVersion networking.k8s.io/v1, and shows service backend specification with name and port number, but does not mention the backend-protocol annotation or the exact service name kubernetes-dashboard or namespace kube-system.

   Since the question is whether the sentence can be fully derived from the ""Context"", and the exact content (namespace kube-system, backend-protocol HTTPS, service name kubernetes-dashboard) is not explicitly stated in the ""Context"", this sentence cannot be fully derived.

2. ""The previous issue was likely due to using an outdated API version (`extensions/v1beta1`) and incorrect service reference fields.""

   The ""Context"" mentions outdated API versions like networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 and the need to use networking.k8s.io/v1. It also discusses the correct service reference fields under backend service name and port number. So this explanation is consistent with the ""Context"".

   This sentence can be fully derived.

3. ""The updated configuration now uses the correct API version (`networking.k8s.io/v1`) and specifies the service correctly under the `backend` section.""

   The ""Context"" clearly shows examples with apiVersion networking.k8s.io/v1 and backend service specification with name and port number. This matches the sentence.

   This sentence can be fully derived.

4. ""Additionally, ensure that the Ingress class is set to `nginx` to align with the Ingress controller in use.""

   The ""Context"" repeatedly mentions the annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx and the importance of specifying the ingress class to target the correct ingress controller.

   This sentence can be fully derived.

5. ""This should resolve the configuration issues you were experiencing.""

   This is a concluding statement or opinion, not a factual statement directly supported by the ""Context"". The ""Context"" does not explicitly say that these changes will resolve issues, only that these are the correct configurations.

### Explanation
I would like to point out that, according to the Kubernetes deprecation guide, the `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API version of Ingress is no longer supported as of v1.22. The changes include:

- The `backend` `servicename` field has been renamed to `service.name`.
- Numeric `backend` `serviceport` fields have been renamed to `service.port.number`.
- String `backend` `serviceport` fields have been renamed to `service.port.name`.
- The `pathType` is now required for each specified path, with options being `Prefix`, `Exact`, and `ImplementationSpecific`.

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

### Explanation
It is common to implement basic authentication for securing access. According to Kubernetes documentation, you can protect access to Traefik by following these steps:

1. Create an authentication file using the `htpasswd` tool. You will be prompted to enter a password for the user:
   ```bash
   htpasswd -c ./auth
   ```

2. Use `kubectl` to create a secret in the `monitoring` namespace with the file generated by `htpasswd`:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret generic mysecret --from-file=auth --namespace=monitoring
   ```

3. Enable basic authentication by adding annotations to the Ingress object:
   - `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: ""basic""`
   - `ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: ""mysecret""`

The complete configuration for basic authentication would look like the YAML provided above. You can apply this configuration using the following command:
```bash
kubectl create -f prometheus-ingress.yaml -n monitoring
```

This setup should work without any issues.","official document: it is possible to add authentication by adding additional annotations in the ingress rule. the source of the authentication is a secret that contains usernames and passwords.  the annotations are: ``` nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: [basic|digest] ```  indicates the [http authentication type: basic or digest access authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617).  ``` nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: secretname ```  the name of the secret that contains the usernames and passwords which are granted access to the `path`s defined in the ingress rules. this annotation also accepts the alternative form ""namespace/secretname"", in which case the secret lookup is performed in the referenced namespace instead of the ingress namespace.  ``` nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret-type: [auth-file|auth-map] ```  the `auth-secret` can have two forms:  -

### Explanation:
1. **Localization**: The issue was with the annotations and the API version used in the Ingress resource.
2. **Reasoning**: The annotations should use the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/` prefix instead of `ingress.kubernetes.io/`. Additionally, the `apiVersion` should be updated to `networking.k8s.io/v1` for compatibility with newer Kubernetes versions.
3. **Remediation**: The Ingress YAML has been corrected to use the proper annotations and API version.
4. **Validation**: The syntax and schema are now correct, ensuring that the basic authentication should work as intended.","```yaml

3. The last item is a concluding sentence about the corrected Ingress YAML functioning as intended.

Now, let's check each sentence against the ""Context"":

1. The YAML manifest:
   - The context states that basic authentication can be added via annotations:
     - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: [basic|digest]`
     - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: secretname`
     - `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-realm: ""realm string""`
   - The YAML uses these exact annotations with values:
     - auth-type: basic
     - auth-realm: traefik
     - auth-secret: mypasswd
   - The API version is `networking.k8s.io/v1` and kind is `Ingress`.
   - The spec includes rules with host, path, backend service name and port.
   - The context supports this structure and annotations.
   - Therefore, this YAML can be fully derived from the context.

2. ""**Factual Grounding**: The Ingress resource has been updated to use the correct annotations for basic authentication with NGINX Ingress Controller, which is consistent with the retrieved knowledge.""
   - The context explains the correct annotations for basic auth.
   - The statement is a summary of that fact.
   - Fully derivable.

3. ""**Avoid Overgeneralization**: The response focuses specifically on the necessary corrections to the Ingress configuration without introducing unrelated recommendations.""
   - The context does not explicitly mention avoiding overgeneralization, but the context is focused on the annotations and their usage.
   - The statement is about the nature of the response, which is meta-commentary.
   - This is not directly derivable from the context content.
   - So, cannot be fully derived.

4. ""**Context-Aligned Terminology**: The annotations and API version are aligned with the NGINX Ingress Controller specifications.""
   - The context provides the annotations and API version.
   - This statement is a summary of that alignment.
   - Fully derivable.

5. ""**Refactor Only What's Necessary**: The structure of the original response has been preserved while correcting the annotations and API version.""
   - This is a meta-comment about how the response was edited.
   - The context does not mention anything about refactoring or preserving structure.
   - Not derivable.

6. ""**Sufficient Context**: The provided context was sufficient to address the issue with the Ingress configuration.""
   - This is a meta-statement about the sufficiency of the context.
   - The context itself does not state this.
   - Not derivable.

7. ""This corrected Ingress YAML should now function as intended, enabling basic authentication for the specified host and path.""
   - The context explains how the annotations enable basic authentication.
   - The statement is a logical conclusion from the context.
   - Fully derivable.

### Explanation
You can use `generateName` instead of `name`, which appends a random suffix to the specified base name. This will modify your template accordingly. However, it's important to note that this approach will only work with the command `kubectl create -f template.yaml`. The `apply` command looks for a resource by its name and attempts to compare definitions, but since this template does not specify a concrete name, it won't function with `apply`.","here's the configuration file for a deployment that has two replicas.

notes on the strategic merge patch the patch you did in the preceding exercise is called a strategic merge patch .
notice that the patch did not replace the containers list.
instead it added a new container to the list.
in other words, the list in the patch was merged with the existing list.
this is not always what happens when you use a strategic merge patch on a list.
in some cases, the list is replaced, not merged.
with a strategic merge patch, a list is either replaced or merged depending on its patch strategy.
the patch strategy is specified by the value of the patchstrategy key in a field tag in the kubernetes source code.
for example, the containers field of podspec struct has a patchstrategy of merge:

type podspec struct {
  ...
  containers []container `json:""containers"" patchstrategy:""merge"" patchmergekey:""name"" ...`
  ...
}

you can also see the patch strategy in the openapi spec :

""io.k8s.api.core.v1.podspec"": {
    ...,
    ""containers"": {
        ""description"": ""list of containers belonging to the pod.  ....""
    },
    ""x-kubernetes-patch-merge-key"": ""name"",
    ""x-kubernetes-patch-strategy"": ""merge""
}

it has the following features to manage application configuration files: generating resources from other sources setting cross-cutting fields for resources composing and customizing collections of resources generating resources configmaps and secrets hold configuration or sensitive data that are used by other kubernetes objects, such as pods.
the source of truth of configmaps or secrets are usually external to a cluster, such as a

.properties

file or an ssh keyfile.
kustomize has secretgenerator and configmapgenerator, which generate secret and configmap from files or literals.
configmapgenerator to generate a configmap from a file, add an entry to the files list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.properties

file:

# create a application.properties file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;application.properties
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
eof

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    foo=bar    
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g

to generate a configmap from an env file, add an entry to the envs list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a

.env

file:

# create a .env file
cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;.env
foo=bar
eof

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  envs:

the generated configmap can be examined with the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-42cfbf598f

note: each variable in the

.env

file becomes a separate key in the configmap that you generate.
this is different from the previous example which embeds a file named

application.properties

(and all its entries) as the value for a single key.
configmaps can also be generated from literal key-value pairs.
to generate a configmap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to the literals list in configmapgenerator.
here is an example of generating a configmap with a data item from a key-value pair:

cat &lt;&lt;eof &gt;./kustomization.yaml
configmapgenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - foo=bar
eof

the generated configmap can be checked by the following command:

kubectl kustomize ./

the generated configmap is:

apiversion: v1
data:
  foo: bar
kind: configmap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk

to use a generated configmap in a deployment, reference it by the name of the configmapgenerator.
kustomize will automatically replace this name with the generated name.
this is an example deployment that uses a generated configmap:

# create an application.properties file

this is because pods are designed as relatively ephemeral, disposable entities.
when a pod gets created (directly by you, or indirectly by a controller ), the new pod is scheduled to run on a node  in your cluster.
the pod remains on that node until the pod finishes execution, the pod object is deleted, the pod is evicted for lack of resources, or the node fails.
note: restarting a container in a pod should not be confused with restarting a pod.
a pod is not a process, but an environment for running container(s).
a pod persists until it is deleted.
the name of a pod must be a valid dns subdomain  value, but this can produce unexpected results for the pod hostname.
for best compatibility, the name should follow the more restrictive rules for a dns label .
pod os feature state:

kubernetes v1.25 [stable]

you should set the

.spec.os.name

field to either windows or linux to indicate the os on which you want the pod to run.
these two are the only operating systems supported for now by kubernetes.
in the future, this list may be expanded.
in kubernetes v1.32, the value of

.spec.os.name

does not affect how the kube-scheduler  picks a node for the pod to run on.
in any cluster where there is more than one operating system for running nodes, you should set the kubernetes.io/os  label correctly on each node, and define pods with a nodeselector based on the operating system label.
the kube-scheduler assigns your pod to a node based on other criteria and may or may not succeed in picking a suitable node placement where the node os is right for the containers in that pod.
the pod security standards  also use this field to avoid enforcing policies that aren't relevant to the operating system.
pods and controllers you can use workload resources to create and manage multiple pods for you.
a controller for the resource handles replication and rollout and automatic healing in case of pod failure.
for example, if a node fails, a controller notices that pods on that node have stopped working and creates a replacement pod.
the scheduler places the replacement pod onto a healthy node.
here are some examples of workload resources that manage one or more pods: deployment  statefulset  daemonset  pod templates controllers for workload  resources create pods from a pod template and manage those pods on your behalf.
podtemplates are specifications for creating pods, and are included in workload resources such as deployments , jobs , and daemonsets .
each controller for a workload resource uses the podtemplate inside the workload object to make actual pods.
the podtemplate is part of the desired state of whatever workload resource you used to run your app.
when you create a pod, you can include environment variables  in the pod template for the containers that run in the pod.
the sample below is a manifest for a simple job with a template that starts one container.
the container in that pod prints a message then pauses.

apiversion: batch/v1
kind: job
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  template:
    # this is the pod template
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: busybox:1.28
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo ""hello, kubernetes!"" &amp;&amp; sleep 3600']
      restartpolicy: onfailure
    # the pod template ends here

modifying the pod template or switching to a new pod template has no direct effect on the pods that already exist.
if you change the pod template for a workload resource, that resource needs to create replacement pods that use the updated template.
for example, the statefulset controller ensures that the running pods match the current pod template for each statefulset object.
if you edit the statefulset to change its pod template, the statefulset starts to create new pods based on the updated template.
eventually, all of the old pods are replaced with new pods, and the update is complete.
each workload resource implements its own rules for handling changes to the pod t","here's the configuration file for a deployment that has two replicas.

### Explanation
When utilizing a provisioner, you typically do not need to create the PersistentVolume (PV) manually. Instead, you can simply create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that specifies the desired storage class, and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) will automatically provision the PV for you with the requested storage size and type.","users request dynamically provisioned storage by including a storage class in their persistentvolumeclaim.
before kubernetes v1.6, this was done via the

volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class

### Explanation
Typically, DNS names are assigned to services rather than pods, meaning that by default, you cannot reference another pod directly using a domain name; you can only use its IP address. However, pods can receive DNS names under specific conditions, which include the presence of a headless service, as detailed in the documentation. The requirements are as follows:

- The pods must have a `hostname` field.
- The pods must have a `subdomain` field.
- There must be a headless service (within the same namespace) that selects the pods.
- The name of the headless service must match the `subdomain` field of the pods.

When these conditions are met, each pod is assigned a fully-qualified domain name in the format:

`my-hostname.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local`

Here, `my-hostname` corresponds to the `hostname` field of the pod, and `my-subdomain` corresponds to the `subdomain` field of the pod. 

**Note:** The DNS name is generated based on the pod's `hostname`, not its `name`.

You can verify this setup by executing the following commands after applying the configuration:

```bash
kubectl exec -ti my-pod-1 bash
```

From within one of the pods, you should be able to resolve the fully-qualified domain names of both pods:

```bash
host my-hostname-1.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local
host my-hostname-2.my-subdomain.default.svc.cluster.local
```

Since the requests are made from the same namespace as the target pods, you can simplify the domain names to:

```bash
host my-hostname-1.my-subdomain
host my-hostname-2.my-subdomain
```","a/aaaa records kube-dns versions, prior to the implementation of the dns specification , had the following dns resolution:

pod-ipv4-address.my-namespace.pod.cluster-domain.example

.
for example, if a pod in the default namespace has the ip address 172.17.0.3, and the domain name for your cluster is

cluster.local

, then the pod has a dns name:

172-17-0-3.default.pod.cluster.local

.
any pods exposed by a service have the following dns resolution available:

pod-ipv4-address.service-name.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

.
pod's hostname and subdomain fields currently when a pod is created, its hostname (as observed from within the pod) is the pod's

metadata.name

value.
the pod spec has an optional hostname field, which can be used to specify a different hostname.
when specified, it takes precedence over the pod's name to be the hostname of the pod (again, as observed from within the pod).
for example, given a pod with

spec.hostname

set to ""my-host"", the pod will have its hostname set to ""my-host"".
the pod spec also has an optional subdomain field which can be used to indicate that the pod is part of sub-group of the namespace.
for example, a pod with

spec.hostname

set to ""foo"", and

spec.subdomain

set to ""bar"", in namespace ""my-namespace"", will have its hostname set to ""foo"" and its fully qualified domain name (fqdn) set to

""foo.bar.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local""

(once more, as observed from within the pod).
if there exists a headless service in the same namespace as the pod, with the same name as the subdomain, the cluster's dns server also returns a and/or aaaa records for the pod's fully qualified hostname.
example:

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: busybox-subdomain
spec:
  selector:
    name: busybox
  clusterip: none
  ports:
  - name: foo # name is not required for single-port services
    port: 1234
---
apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: busybox1
  labels:
    name: busybox
spec:
  hostname: busybox-1
  subdomain: busybox-subdomain
  containers:
  - image: busybox:1.28
    command:
      - sleep
      - ""3600""
    name: busybox
---
apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: busybox2
  labels:
    name: busybox
spec:
  hostname: busybox-2
  subdomain: busybox-subdomain
  containers:
  - image: busybox:1.28
    command:
      - sleep
      - ""3600""
    name: busybox

given the above service ""busybox-subdomain"" and the pods which set

spec.subdomain

to ""busybox-subdomain"", the first pod will see its own fqdn as

""busybox-1.busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example""

.
dns serves a and/or aaaa records at that name, pointing to the pod's ip.
both pods ""busybox1"" and ""busybox2"" will have their own address records.
an endpointslice  can specify the dns hostname for any endpoint addresses, along with its ip.
note: a and aaaa records are not created for pod names since hostname is missing for the pod.
a pod with no hostname but with subdomain will only create the a or aaaa record for the headless service (

busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

), pointing to the pods' ip addresses.
also, the pod needs to be ready in order to have a record unless publishnotreadyaddresses=true is set on the service.
pod's sethostnameasfqdn field feature state:

kubernetes v1.22 [stable]

when a pod is configured to have fully qualified domain name (fqdn), its hostname is the short hostname.
for example, if you have a pod with the fully qualified domain name

busybox-1.busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

, then by default the hostname command inside that pod returns busybox-1 and the hostname --fqdn command returns the fqdn.
when you set sethostnameasfqdn: true in the pod spec, the kubelet writes the pod's fqdn into the hostname for that pod's namespace.
in this case, both hostname and hostname --fqdn return the pod's fqdn.
note: in linux, the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname) is limi","to enable pod-to-pod communication using pod hostnames in a job, you must do the following: set up a headless service  with a valid label selector for the pods created by your job.
the headless service must be in the same namespace as the job.
one easy way to do this is to use the job-name: <your-job-name> selector, since the job-name label will be automatically added by kubernetes.
this configuration will trigger the dns system to create records of the hostnames of the pods running your job.
configure the headless service as subdomain service for the job pods by including the following value in your job template spec: subdomain: <headless-svc-name> example below is a working example of a job with pod-to-pod communication via pod hostnames enabled.
the job is completed only after all pods successfully ping each other using hostnames.
note: in the bash script executed on each pod in the example below, the pod hostnames can be prefixed by the namespace as well if the pod needs to be reached from outside the namespace.

            while [ $gotstatus -ne $wantstatus ]
            do                                       
              ping -c 1 example-job-${i}.headless-svc &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
              gotstatus=$?                
              if [ $gotstatus -ne $wantstatus ]; then
                echo ""failed to ping pod example-job-${i}.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...""
                sleep 1
              fi

            echo ""successfully pinged pod: example-job-${i}.headless-svc""
          done

after applying the example above, reach each other over the network using:

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

.
you should see output similar to the following:

kubectl logs example-job-0-qws42



failed to ping pod example-job-0.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...
successfully pinged pod: example-job-0.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-1.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-2.headless-svc

note: keep in mind that the

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

name format used in this example would not work with dns policy set to none or default.
you can learn more about pod dns policies here .
========================================","you need to have a kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
it is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.
if you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using minikube  or you can use one of these kubernetes playgrounds: killercoda  play with kubernetes  your cluster must be configured to use the coredns addon  or its precursor, kube-dns.
your kubernetes server must be at or later than version v1.6.
to check the version, enter kubectl version.
create a simple pod to use as a test environment admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml

  containers:
  - name: dnsutils
    image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.39
    imagepullpolicy: ifnotpresent
  restartpolicy: always

note: this example creates a pod in the default namespace.
dns name resolution for services depends on the namespace of the pod.
for more information, review dns for services and pods .
use that manifest to create a pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml

pod/dnsutils created …and verify its status:

kubectl get pods dnsutils



name       ready     status    restarts   age
dnsutils   1/1       running   0          &lt;some-time&gt;

once that pod is running, you can exec nslookup in that environment.
if you see something like the following, dns is working correctly.

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10

name:      kubernetes.default
address 1: 10.0.0.1

if the nslookup command fails, check the following: check the local dns configuration first take a look inside the resolv.conf file.
(see customizing dns service  and known issues  below for more information)

kubectl exec -ti dnsutils -- cat /etc/resolv.conf

verify that the search path and name server are set up like the following (note that search path may vary for different cloud providers):

search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local google.internal c.gce_project_id.internal
nameserver 10.0.0.10
options ndots:5

errors such as the following indicate a problem with the coredns (or kube-dns) add-on or with associated services:

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'

or

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'

check if the dns pod is running use the

kubectl get pods

command to verify that the dns pod is running.

kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns



name                       ready     status    restarts   age
...

coredns-7b96bf9f76-mvmmt   1/1       running   0           1h
...

note: the value for label k8s-app is kube-dns for both coredns and kube-dns deployments.
if you see that no coredns pod is running or that the pod has failed/completed, the dns add-on may not be deployed by default in your current environment and you will have to deploy it manually.
check for errors in the dns pod use the kubectl logs command to see logs for the dns containers.
for coredns:

kubectl logs --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

here is an example of a healthy coredns log:

if there exists a headless service in the same namespace as the pod, with the same name as the subdomain, the cluster's dns server also returns a and/or aaaa records for the pod's fully qualified hostname.
example:

apiversion: v1
kind: service
metadata:
  name: busybox-subdomain
spec:
  selector:
    name: busybox
  clusterip: none
  ports:
  - name: foo # name is not required for single-port services
    port: 1234
---
apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: busybox1
  labels:
    name: busybox
spec:
  hostname: busybox-1
  subdomain: busybox-subdomain
  containers:
  - image: busybox:1.28
    command:
      - sleep
      - ""3600""
    name: busybox
---
apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: busybox2
  labels:
    name: busybox
spec:
  hostname: busybox-2
  subdomain: busybox-subdomain
  containers:
  - image: busybox:1.28
    command:
      - sleep
      - ""3600""
    name: busybox

given the above service ""busybox-subdomain"" and the pods which set

spec.subdomain

to ""busybox-subdomain"", the first pod will see its own fqdn as

""busybox-1.busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example""

.
dns serves a and/or aaaa records at that name, pointing to the pod's ip.
both pods ""busybox1"" and ""busybox2"" will have their own address records.
an endpointslice  can specify the dns hostname for any endpoint addresses, along with its ip.
note: a and aaaa records are not created for pod names since hostname is missing for the pod.
a pod with no hostname but with subdomain will only create the a or aaaa record for the headless service (

busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

), pointing to the pods' ip addresses.
also, the pod needs to be ready in order to have a record unless publishnotreadyaddresses=true is set on the service.
pod's sethostnameasfqdn field feature state:

kubernetes v1.22 [stable]

when a pod is configured to have fully qualified domain name (fqdn), its hostname is the short hostname.
for example, if you have a pod with the fully qualified domain name

busybox-1.busybox-subdomain.my-namespace.svc.cluster-domain.example

, then by default the hostname command inside that pod returns busybox-1 and the hostname --fqdn command returns the fqdn.
when you set sethostnameasfqdn: true in the pod spec, the kubelet writes the pod's fqdn into the hostname for that pod's namespace.
in this case, both hostname and hostname --fqdn return the pod's fqdn.
note: in linux, the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname) is limi to enable pod-to-pod communication using pod hostnames in a job, you must do the following: set up a headless service  with a valid label selector for the pods created by your job.
the headless service must be in the same namespace as the job.
one easy way to do this is to use the job-name: <your-job-name> selector, since the job-name label will be automatically added by kubernetes.
this configuration will trigger the dns system to create records of the hostnames of the pods running your job.
configure the headless service as subdomain service for the job pods by including the following value in your job template spec: subdomain: <headless-svc-name> example below is a working example of a job with pod-to-pod communication via pod hostnames enabled.
the job is completed only after all pods successfully ping each other using hostnames.
note: in the bash script executed on each pod in the example below, the pod hostnames can be prefixed by the namespace as well if the pod needs to be reached from outside the namespace.

            while [ $gotstatus -ne $wantstatus ]
            do

              gotstatus=$?                
              if [ $gotstatus -ne $wantstatus ]; then
                echo ""failed to ping pod example-job-${i}.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...""
                sleep 1
              fi
            done                                                         
            echo ""successfully pinged pod: example-job-${i}.headless-svc""
          done

after applying the example above, reach each other over the network using:

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

.
you should see output similar to the following:

kubectl logs example-job-0-qws42



failed to ping pod example-job-0.headless-svc, retrying in 1 second...
successfully pinged pod: example-job-0.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-1.headless-svc
successfully pinged pod: example-job-2.headless-svc

note: keep in mind that the

&lt;pod-hostname&gt;.&lt;headless-service-name&gt;

name format used in this example would not work with dns policy set to none or default.
you can learn more about pod dns policies here .
======================================== you need to have a kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
it is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.
if you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using minikube  or you can use one of these kubernetes playgrounds: killercoda  play with kubernetes  your cluster must be configured to use the coredns addon  or its precursor, kube-dns.
your kubernetes server must be at or later than version v1.6.
to check the version, enter kubectl version.
create a simple pod to use as a test environment admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: dnsutils
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: dnsutils
    image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.39
    imagepullpolicy: ifnotpresent
  restartpolicy: always

note: this example creates a pod in the default namespace.
dns name resolution for services depends on the namespace of the pod.
for more information, review dns for services and pods .
use that manifest to create a pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml

pod/dnsutils created …and verify its status:

kubectl get pods dnsutils



name       ready     status    restarts   age
dnsutils   1/1       running   0          &lt;some-time&gt;

once that pod is running, you can exec nslookup in that environment.
if you see something like the following, dns is working correctly.

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10

name:      kubernetes.default
address 1: 10.0.0.1

if the nslookup command fails, check the following: check the local dns configuration first take a look inside the resolv.conf file.
(see customizing dns service  and known issues  below for more information)

kubectl exec -ti dnsutils -- cat /etc/resolv.conf

verify that the search path and name server are set up like the following (note that search path may vary for different cloud providers):

search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local google.internal c.gce_project_id.internal
nameserver 10.0.0.10
options ndots:5

errors such as the following indicate a problem with the coredns (or kube-dns) add-on or with associated services:

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'

or

kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default



server:    10.0.0.10
address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'

check if the dns pod is running use the

kubectl get pods

command to verify that the dns pod is running.

kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns



name                       ready     status    restarts   age
...
coredns-7b96bf9f76-5hsxb   1/1       running   0           1h
coredns-7b96bf9f76-mvmmt   1/1       running   0           1h
...

note: the value for label k8s-app is kube-dns for both coredns and kube-dns deployments.
if you see that no coredns pod is running or that the pod has failed/completed, the dns add-on may not be deployed by default in your current environment and you will have to deploy it manually.
check for errors in the dns pod use the kubectl logs command to see logs for the dns containers.
for coredns:

kubectl logs --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns

here is an example of a healthy coredns log:

.:53
2018/08/15 14:37:17 [info] coredns-1.2.2
2018/08/15 14:37:17 [info] linux/amd64, go1.10.3, 2e322f6

2018/08/15 14:37:17 [info] plugin/reload: running configuration md5 = 24e6c59e83ce706f07bcc82c31b1ea1c

see if there are any suspicious or unexpected messages in the logs.
is dns service up? verify that the dns service is up by using the

kubectl get service

command.

### Explanation:
To enable hostname resolution between the two pods, a headless service (`headless-svc`) is created with `clusterIP: None`. The deployment is updated to include the `subdomain` field, which allows the pods to resolve each other's hostnames using the format `<pod-hostname>.<headless-service-name>`. This configuration ensures that the DNS system creates records for the pod hostnames, enabling them to communicate with each other.","```yaml

### Explanation
In summary, the BusyBox image does not come with `kubectl` pre-installed. You can verify this by running the command `kubectl run -i --tty busybox --image=busybox -- sh`, which will start a BusyBox pod with an interactive shell. I recommend using the `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image instead. Additionally, ensure that you have the appropriate RBAC permissions set up, as you may encounter a ""forbidden"" error when trying to access services. The provided YAML configuration includes a Role and RoleBinding to grant the necessary permissions, along with a ServiceAccount and a CronJob that utilizes the `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image to patch a deployment in the specified namespace.","cron jobs require a config file.

run the example cronjob by using this command:

kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/job/cronjob.yaml

the output is similar to this:

cronjob.batch/hello created

after creating the cron job, get its status using this command:

hello   */1 * * * *   false     0        &lt;none&gt;          10s

as you can see from the results of the command, the cron job has not scheduled or run any jobs yet.
watch  for the job to be created in around one minute:

kubectl get jobs --watch

the output is similar to this:

**Explanation:** The original CronJob failed because the `busybox` image does not include `kubectl`. By changing the image to `bitnami/kubectl:latest`, which contains `kubectl`, the command can be executed successfully. Additionally, I corrected the `apiVersion` to `batch/v1` and `jobTemplate` to match the correct casing.","```yaml

**Explanation:** The original CronJob configuration failed because the `busybox` image does not include `kubectl`. By changing the image to `bitnami/kubectl:latest`, which contains `kubectl`, the command can be executed successfully. This ensures that the necessary tools are available for the patch operation.

1. The YAML manifest for a CronJob with specific fields and a patch command using the `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image.
2. ""**Explanation:** The original CronJob configuration failed because the `busybox` image does not include `kubectl`.""
3. ""By changing the image to `bitnami/kubectl:latest`, which contains `kubectl`, the command can be executed successfully.""
4. ""This ensures that the necessary tools are available for the patch operation.""
5. ""The `apiVersion` and `jobTemplate` structure are correctly aligned with Kubernetes specifications.""

Now, let's check if each sentence can be fully derived from the ""Context"":

1. The YAML manifest in the Answer is quite specific, including the use of `bitnami/kubectl:latest` image and a patch command with `kubectl`. The Context only shows a CronJob manifest using `busybox:1.28` image, running a simple command (`date; echo hello from the kubernetes cluster`). There is no mention of using `bitnami/kubectl:latest`, nor any patch command or `kubectl` usage in the manifest. Therefore, this sentence cannot be fully derived from the Context.

2. The Explanation sentence states that the original CronJob failed because `busybox` does not include `kubectl`. The Context shows the original manifest uses `busybox:1.28` and runs a simple command, but it does not mention any failure or the absence of `kubectl` in `busybox`. So this sentence cannot be fully derived from the Context.

3. The sentence about changing the image to `bitnami/kubectl:latest` to successfully execute the command is not supported by the Context, which does not mention changing the image or the success of such a change. So this sentence cannot be fully derived.

4. The sentence about ensuring necessary tools are available for the patch operation is an inference based on the previous sentences, but the Context does not mention any patch operation or tools availability. So this sentence cannot be fully derived.

5. The sentence about `apiVersion` and `jobTemplate` structure being correctly aligned with Kubernetes specifications is not explicitly stated or implied in the Context. The Context shows a manifest with some fields, but does not comment on correctness or alignment with specs. So this sentence cannot be fully derived.

### Explanation
It appears that the ingress definition needs to be updated to the new API version. The `host` entry specified under the `rules` section must correspond to one of the `hosts` entries defined under the `tls` section. This ensures that the ingress is properly configured for SSL termination with the specified secret.","official document: using this annotation you can add additional configuration to the nginx location. for example:  ```yaml nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |   more_set_headers ""request-id: $req_id""; ```  be aware this can be dangerous in multi-tenant clusters, as it can lead to people with otherwise limited permissions being able to retrieve all secrets on the cluster. the recommended mitigation for this threat is to disable this feature, so it may not work for you. see cve-2021-25742 and the [related issue on github](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7837) for more information. medium website: apiversion networking.k8s.iov1beta1 kind ingress metadata annotations kubernetes.ioingress.class nginx nginx.ingress.kubernetes.ioconfiguration-snippet rewrite source?

### Explanation:
1. **Localization**: The issue is likely due to the incorrect specification of the `tls` section in the Ingress resource. The `secretName` should be specified correctly, and the `hosts` field must be included.
2. **Reasoning**: The Ingress resource must specify the domain(s) for which the TLS certificate is valid. Without the `hosts` field, the Ingress controller may not associate the TLS secret with the correct domain, leading to the use of default certificates.
3. **Remediation**: The corrected YAML includes the `hosts` field under the `tls` section and specifies the domain in the `rules` section.
4. **Validation**: The YAML syntax is correct, and it adheres to the Kubernetes Ingress schema. Ensure that the domain matches the one for which the TLS certificate was issued.","```yaml

I was able to see the YAML that gets executed by Helm by using the `--dry-run --debug` options at the end of the `helm install` command. During this process, I observed that the controller is executed with the following configuration: `--configmap={namespace-where-the-nginx-ingress-is-deployed}/{name-of-the-helm-chart}-nginx-ingress-controller`.

### Explanation
To simplify the testing process, I utilized an example from the official Kubernetes documentation, making minor adjustments to demonstrate various scenarios. I can confirm that when `backoffLimit` is set to 0 and `restartPolicy` is set to Never, the behavior is as expected, with no retries occurring. It's important to note that each execution of your job, which in this case is scheduled to run every 60 seconds (`schedule: ""*/1 * * * *""`), is not considered a retry.

Let's examine the following example (base YAML available here):

This configuration spawns a new CronJob every 60 seconds according to the schedule, regardless of whether it fails or succeeds. In this specific instance, it is set to fail since we are attempting to execute a non-existent command.

You can observe the status by running:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1587558720-pgqq9   0/1     Error               0          61s
hello-1587558780-gpzxl   0/1     ContainerCreating    0          1s
```

As shown, there are no retries. Even though the first pod failed, a new one is created exactly 60 seconds later as specified. I want to emphasize that this is not a retry.

Conversely, if we modify the example to set `backoffLimit: 3`, we can observe retries in action. In this case, new pods are created more frequently than every 60 seconds, indicating retries.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                     READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
hello-1587565260-7db6j   0/1     Error    0          106s
hello-1587565260-tcqhv   0/1     Error    0          104s
hello-1587565260-vnbcl   0/1     Error    0          94s
hello-1587565320-7nc6z   0/1     Error    0          44s
hello-1587565320-l4p8r   0/1     Error    0          14s
hello-1587565320-mjnb6   0/1     Error    0          46s
hello-1587565320-wqbm2   0/1     Error    0          34s
```

Here, we see three retries (pod creation attempts) associated with the `hello-1587565260` job and four retries (including the original attempt, which is not counted in the `backoffLimit: 3`) related to the `hello-1587565320` job.

The jobs themselves continue to run according to the schedule, at 60-second intervals:

```bash

However, due to the `backoffLimit` set to 3, every time the pod responsible for executing the job fails, three additional retries are initiated.

I hope this clarifies any potential confusion regarding the operation of CronJobs in Kubernetes. If you're interested in executing a task just once rather than at regular intervals, consider using a simple Job instead of a CronJob. Additionally, if you wish to run this specific job regularly but less frequently, such as once every 24 hours, you may want to adjust your Cron configuration accordingly.","with the following example, you can learn how to use pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary pod restarts when a pod failure indicates a non-retriable software bug.
first, create a job based on the config: /controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob.yaml 

apiversion: batch/v1

metadata:
  name: job-pod-failure-policy-failjob
spec:

        command: [""bash""]
        args:
        - -c
        - echo ""hello world! i'm going to exit with 42 to simulate a software bug."" &amp;&amp; sleep 30 &amp;&amp; exit 42
  backofflimit: 6
  podfailurepolicy:
    rules:
    - action: failjob
      onexitcodes:
        containername: main
        operator: in
        values: [42]

by running:

kubectl create -f job-pod-failure-policy-failjob.yaml

after around 30s the entire job should be terminated.
inspect the status of the job by running:

kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-failjob -o yaml

in the job status, the following conditions display: failuretarget condition: has a reason field set to podfailurepolicy and a message field with more information about the termination, like

container main for pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob-8ckj8 failed with exit code 42 matching failjob rule at index 0

.
the job controller adds this condition as soon as the job is considered a failure.
for details, see termination of job pods .
failed condition: same reason and message as the failuretarget condition.
the job controller adds this condition after all of the job's pods are terminated.
for comparison, if the pod failure policy was disabled it would take 6 retries of the pod, taking at least 2 minutes.
clean up delete the job you created:

kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob

the cluster automatically cleans up the pods.
========================================","with the following example, you can learn how to use pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary pod restarts based on custom pod conditions.
note: the example below works since version 1.27 as it relies on transitioning of deleted pods, in the pending phase, to a terminal phase (see: pod phase ).

note that, the image is misconfigured, as it does not exist.
inspect the status of the job's pods by running:

kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml

you will see output similar to this:

      reason: imagepullbackoff
      ...
phase: pending

note that the pod remains in the pending phase as it fails to pull the misconfigured image.
this, in principle, could be a transient issue and the image could get pulled.
however, in this case, the image does not exist so we indicate this fact by a custom condition.
add the custom condition.

  - type: configissue
    status: ""true""
    reason: ""nonexistingimage""
    lasttransitiontime: ""$(date -u +""%y-%m-%dt%h:%m:%sz"")""
eof

second, select one of the pods created by the job by running:

podname=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

then, apply the patch on one of the pods by running the following command:

kubectl patch pod $podname --subresource=status --patch-file=patch.yaml

if applied successfully, you will get a notification like this: pod/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp patched delete the pod to transition it to failed phase, by running the command:

kubectl delete pods/$podname

inspect the status of the job by running:

kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml

in the job status, see a job failed condition with the field reason equal podfailurepolicy.
additionally, the message field contains a more detailed information about the job termination, such as:

.
note: in a production environment, the steps 3 and 4 should be automated by a user-provided controller.

### Explanation
To begin with, you need to set up the Redis service as a ClusterIP service, which will make it accessible only to other services within the cluster. This can be achieved by omitting the line that specifies the service type. 

When configuring your API to connect to Redis, you should use the address `app-api-redis-svc:6379`. 

That's all there is to it! I have numerous services that communicate with each other in this manner. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out in the comments.","# create a service for a replicated nginx, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose rc nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # create a service for a replication controller identified by type and name specified in ""nginx-controller.yaml"", which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose -f nginx-controller.yaml --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # create a service for a pod valid-pod, which serves on port 444 with the name ""frontend""
  kubectl expose pod valid-pod --port=444 --name=frontend
  
  # create a second service based on the above service, exposing the container port 8443 as port 443 with the name ""nginx-https""
  kubectl expose service nginx --port=443 --target-port=8443 --name=nginx-https
  
  # create a service for a replicated streaming application on port 4100 balancing udp traffic and named 'video-stream'.
  kubectl expose rc streamer --port=4100 --protocol=udp --name=video-stream
  
  # create a service for a replicated nginx using replica set, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose rs nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000
  
  # create a service for an nginx deployment, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

### Explanation
The capability to autoscale StatefulSets using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) was introduced in Kubernetes version 1.9, which means that earlier versions do not support this feature. If you are using Kubernetes 1.9 or later, you can implement autoscaling for your StatefulSets as shown in the YAML example above. For further details, you can refer to the following link: 

[GitHub Issue #44033](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/44033)","graph bt hpa[horizontal pod autoscaler] --> scale[scale] subgraph rc[rc / deployment] scale end scale -.-> pod1[pod 1] scale -.-> pod2[pod 2] scale -.-> pod3[pod n] classdef hpa fill:#d5a6bd,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; classdef rc fill:#f9cb9c,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; classdef scale fill:#b6d7a8,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; classdef pod fill:#9fc5e8,stroke:#1e1e1d,stroke-width:1px,color:#1e1e1d; class hpa hpa; class rc rc; class scale scale; class pod1,pod2,pod3 pod javascript must be enabled  to view this content figure 1.
horizontalpodautoscaler controls the scale of a deployment and its replicaset kubernetes implements horizontal pod autoscaling as a control loop that runs intermittently (it is not a continuous process).
the interval is set by the --horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period parameter to the kube-controller-manager  (and the default interval is 15 seconds).
once during each period, the controller manager queries the resource utilization against the metrics specified in each horizontalpodautoscaler definition.
the controller manager finds the target resource defined by the scaletargetref, then selects the pods based on the target resource's

.spec.selector

labels, and obtains the metrics from either the resource metrics api (for per-pod resource metrics), or the custom metrics api (for all other metrics).
for per-pod resource metrics (like cpu), the controller fetches the metrics from the resource metrics api for each pod targeted by the horizontalpodautoscaler.
then, if a target utilization value is set, the controller calculates the utilization value as a percentage of the equivalent resource request  on the containers in each pod.
if a target raw value is set, the raw metric values are used directly.
the controller then takes the mean of the utilization or the raw value (depending on the type of target specified) across all targeted pods, and produces a ratio used to scale the number of desired replicas.
please note that if some of the pod's containers do not have the relevant resource request set, cpu utilization for the pod will not be defined and the autoscaler will not take any action for that metric.
see the algorithm details  section below for more information about how the autoscaling algorithm works.
for per-pod custom metrics, the controller functions similarly to per-pod resource metrics, except that it works with raw values, not utilization values.
for object metrics and external metrics, a single metric is fetched, which describes the object in question.
this metric is compared to the target value, to produce a ratio as above.
in the autoscaling/v2 api version, this value can optionally be divided by the number of pods before the comparison is made.
the common use for horizontalpodautoscaler is to configure it to fetch metrics from aggregated apis  (

metrics.k8s.io

,

custom.metrics.k8s.io

, or

external.metrics.k8s.io

).
the

metrics.k8s.io

api is usually provided by an add-on named metrics server, which needs to be launched separately.
for more information about resource metrics, see metrics server .
support for metrics apis  explains the stability guarantees and support status for these different apis.
the horizontalpodautoscaler controller accesses corresponding workload resources that support scaling (such as deployments and statefulset).
these resources each have a subresource named scale, an interface that allows you to dynamically set the number of replicas and examine each of their current states.
for general information about subresources in the kubernetes api, see kubernetes api concepts .
algorithm details from the most basic perspective, the horizontalpodautoscaler controller operates on the ratio between desired metric value and current metric value:

desiredreplicas = ceil[currentreplicas * ( currentmetricvalue / desiredmetricvalue )]

for example, if the current metric value is 200m, and the desired value is 100m, the number of replicas will be doubled, since

kubernetes v1.23 [stable]

(the autoscaling/v2beta2 api version previously provided this ability as a beta feature) provided that you use the autoscaling/v2 api version, you can specify multiple metrics for a horizontalpodautoscaler to scale on.
then, the horizontalpodautoscaler controller evaluates each metric, and proposes a new scale based on that metric.
the horizontalpodautoscaler takes the maximum scale recommended for each metric and sets the workload to that size (provided that this isn't larger than the overall maximum that you configured).
========================================","any hpa target can be scaled based on the resource usage of the pods in the scaling target.
when defining the pod specification the resource requests like cpu and memory should be specified.
this is used to determine the resource utilization and used by the hpa controller to scale the target up or down.
to use resource utilization based scaling specify a metric source like this:

type: resource
resource:
  name: cpu
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60

with this metric the hpa controller will keep the average utilization of the pods in the scaling target at 60%.
utilization is the ratio between the current usage of resource to the requested resources of the pod.
see algorithm  for more details about how the utilization is calculated and averaged.
note: since the resource usages of all the containers are summed up the total pod utilization may not accurately represent the individual container resource usage.
this could lead to situations where a single container might be running with high usage and the hpa will not scale out because the overall pod usage is still within acceptable limits.
container resource metrics feature state:

kubernetes v1.30 [stable]

(enabled by default: true) the horizontalpodautoscaler api also supports a container metric source where the hpa can track the resource usage of individual containers across a set of pods, in order to scale the target resource.
this lets you configure scaling thresholds for the containers that matter most in a particular pod.
for example, if you have a web application and a sidecar container that provides logging, you can scale based on the resource use of the web application, ignoring the sidecar container and its resource use.
if you revise the target resource to have a new pod specification with a different set of containers, you should revise the hpa spec if that newly added container should also be used for scaling.
if the specified container in the metric source is not present or only present in a subset of the pods then those pods are ignored and the recommendation is recalculated.
see algorithm  for more details about the calculation.
to use container resources for autoscaling define a metric source as follows:

type: containerresource
containerresource:
  name: cpu
  container: application
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60

in the above example the hpa controller scales the target such that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is 60%.
note: if you change the name of a container that a horizontalpodautoscaler is tracking, you can make that change in a specific order to ensure scaling remains available and effective whilst the change is being applied.
before you update the resource that defines the container (such as a deployment), you should update the associated hpa to track both the new and old container names.
this way, the hpa is able to calculate a scaling recommendation throughout the update process.
once you have rolled out the container name change to the workload resource, tidy up by removing the old container name from the hpa specification.

if the specified container in the metric source is not present or only present in a subset of the pods then those pods are ignored and the recommendation is recalculated.
see algorithm  for more details about the calculation.
to use container resources for autoscaling define a metric source as follows:

type: containerresource
containerresource:
  name: cpu
  container: application
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60

in the above example the hpa controller scales the target such that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is 60%.
note: if you change the name of a container that a horizontalpodautoscaler is tracking, you can make that change in a specific order to ensure scaling remains available and effective whilst the change is being applied.
before you update the resource that defines the container (such as a deployment), you should update the associated hpa to track both the new and old container names.
this way, the hpa is able to calculate a scaling recommendation throughout the update process.
once you have rolled out the container name change to the workload resource, tidy up by removing the old container name from the hpa specification.

The fix involves updating the `apiVersion` of the HPA to `autoscaling/v2`, changing the `scaleTargetRef` to use `apps/v1` for StatefulSets, and correcting the field names to match the expected casing (`minReplicas`, `maxReplicas`, `target`, and `averageUtilization`). This ensures compatibility with the current Kubernetes API and resolves the issue with the HPA controller not finding the requested resource for scaling.","```yaml

The fix involves updating the `apiVersion` of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to `autoscaling/v2`, ensuring that the `scaleTargetRef` correctly references the StatefulSet with `apiVersion: apps/v1`. Additionally, the field names have been adjusted to match the expected casing, specifically using `Resource` for the `type` under `metrics`. This alignment with the Kubernetes API specifications will help ensure that the HPA functions correctly and can effectively scale the StatefulSet based on CPU utilization.","1530.0, 1536.0, 1534.0","The ""Answer"" contains 4 sentences:

1. The YAML manifest for a HorizontalPodAutoscaler with apiVersion autoscaling/v2, targeting a StatefulSet with apiVersion apps/v1, minReplicas 2, maxReplicas 3, and a CPU utilization metric with averageUtilization 80.
2. Explanation that the fix involves updating the apiVersion of the HPA to autoscaling/v2 and ensuring scaleTargetRef references StatefulSet with apiVersion apps/v1.
3. Statement that field names have been adjusted to match expected casing, specifically using Resource for the type under metrics.
4. Statement that this alignment with Kubernetes API specs will help ensure the HPA functions correctly and scales based on CPU utilization.

Now, checking each sentence against the ""Context"":

1. The YAML manifest details (apiVersion autoscaling/v2, kind HorizontalPodAutoscaler, scaleTargetRef with apiVersion apps/v1 and kind StatefulSet, minReplicas 2, maxReplicas 3, metrics with type Resource, resource name cpu, target type Utilization, averageUtilization 80) — The context mentions the autoscaling/v2 API version, the scaleTargetRef referencing StatefulSet, the use of resource metrics for CPU utilization with averageUtilization, and the structure of the HPA spec. However, the exact YAML manifest is not explicitly given in the context, but all elements are described in detail and can be fully derived from the context content.

2. The fix involves updating apiVersion to autoscaling/v2 and ensuring scaleTargetRef references StatefulSet with apiVersion apps/v1 — The context explicitly mentions autoscaling/v2 API version and that scaleTargetRef references StatefulSet with apiVersion apps/v1. So this sentence can be fully derived.

3. Field names adjusted to match expected casing, specifically using Resource for the type under metrics — The context shows the example metric source with ""type: resource"" (lowercase 'resource'), not ""Resource"" with uppercase R. The context uses lowercase 'resource' in the example:

```
type: resource
resource:
  name: cpu
  target:
    type: utilization
    averageutilization: 60
```

So the claim that field names have been adjusted to use uppercase ""Resource"" is not supported by the context. The context uses lowercase 'resource' for the type. Therefore, this sentence cannot be fully derived from the context.

4. This alignment with Kubernetes API specs will help ensure HPA functions correctly and scales based on CPU utilization — The context explains how the HPA works with CPU utilization metrics and the importance of correct spec for scaling. This is a reasonable inference and can be derived from the context.

Summary:

- Sentence 1: can be derived (all elements described)
- Sentence 2: can be derived
- Sentence 3: cannot be derived (context uses lowercase 'resource', not uppercase 'Resource')
- Sentence 4: can be derived

Therefore, 3 sentences can be fully derived, 1 cannot.

### Explanation
I have conducted several tests involving `IngressClass`, `Ingress`, and the NGINX Ingress Controller. Here are the scenarios I explored:

**Scenario 1:**
- Custom-named `IngressClass`
- NGINX Ingress Controller with the default `--ingress-class` set to `nginx`
- `Ingress` using the same name for `ingressClassName`

**Output:** Response 404

**Scenario 2:**
- Custom-named `IngressClass`
- NGINX Ingress Controller with `--ingress-class` set to `ingress-test`
- `Ingress` using the same name for `ingressClassName`

**Output:** Response 404

**Scenario 3:**
- `IngressClass` named `test`
- NGINX Ingress Controller with `--ingress-class` set to `test`
- `Ingress` using `test` in `ingressClassName`

**Output:** Proper response

**Scenario 4:**
- `IngressClass` named `nginx`
- NGINX Ingress Controller with `--ingress-class` set to `nginx`
- `Ingress` using `nginx` in `ingressClassName`

**Output:** Proper response

**Conclusion:**
It's important to note that there are three types of NGINX: the open-source NGINX Ingress Controller (which you are likely using), NGINX Inc., and NGINX Inc. Plus. In one of my scenarios, when I specified `spec.controller: nginx.org/ingress-controller` with the NGINX Ingress Controller using `--ingress-class=nginx`, the NGINX Ingress Controller pod entered a crash loop. The logs indicated an invalid `IngressClass` (spec.controller) value of ""nginx.org/ingress-controller"", which should be ""k8s.io/ingress-nginx"".

To replicate this behavior, you need to deploy an `IngressClass` with the specific controller and then deploy NGINX. 

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: IngressClass
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  controller: nginx.org/ingress-controller
```

After deploying the NGINX Ingress Controller, the controller pod will be in a crash loop state. The logs will show an error indicating that the `spec.controller` value is invalid. It only works when the `IngressClass` name is set to `nginx`. 

I would suggest that `nginx.org/ingress-controller` is intended for NGINX Inc. and `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` is for the open-source NGINX Ingress. If a custom value is used for the `--ingress-class` argument in the controller deployment manifest, the presence or absence of an `IngressClass` object with the same name does not affect cluster behavior, as long as the `ingressClassName` in the `Ingress` spec matches the controller argument. Furthermore, if the `IngressClass` is present, the `spec.controller` can have any value that matches the required ""domain-like"" pattern without impacting the `Ingress` workflow.

Additionally, the `Ingress` functions correctly if the correct value for the `ingress-class` is set either in the `spec.ingressClassName` property or in the `metadata.annotations.kubernetes.io/ingress.class`. However, if both values are set in the same `Ingress` object, it will result in an error:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
```

The error message will indicate that the `Ingress` ""test-ingress"" is invalid because the annotation and the class field cannot be set simultaneously. Please note that this was tested only with the NGINX Ingress Controller. If you plan to use `IngressClass` with other controllers like Traefik or Ambassador, be sure to check their release notes for compatibility.","ingresses can be implemented by different controllers, often with different configuration.
each ingress should specify a class, a reference to an ingressclass resource that contains additional configuration including the name of the controller that should implement the class.

the

.spec.parameters

field of an ingressclass lets you reference another resource that provides configuration related to that ingressclass.
the specific type of parameters to use depends on the ingress controller that you specify in the

.spec.controller

field of the ingressclass.
ingressclass scope depending on your ingress controller, you may be able to use parameters that you set cluster-wide, or just for one namespace.

if you set the

field and don't set

.spec.parameters.scope

, or if you set

.spec.parameters.scope

to cluster, then the ingressclass refers to a cluster-scoped resource.
the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a cluster-scoped api (possibly a custom resource), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific cluster scoped resource for that api.

if you set the

field and set

.spec.parameters.scope

to namespace, then the ingressclass refers to a namespaced-scoped resource.
you must also set the namespace field within

.spec.parameters

to the namespace that contains the parameters you want to use.
the kind (in combination the apigroup) of the parameters refers to a namespaced api (for example: configmap), and the name of the parameters identifies a specific resource in the namespace you specified in namespace.
namespace-scoped parameters help the cluster operator delegate control over the configuration (for example: load balancer settings, api gateway definition) that is used for a workload.
if you used a cluster-scoped parameter then either: the cluster operator team needs to approve a different team's changes every time there's a new configuration change being applied.
the cluster operator must define specific access controls, such as rbac  roles and bindings, that let the application team make changes to the cluster-scoped parameters resource.
the ingressclass api itself is always cluster-scoped.
here is an example of an ingressclass that refers to parameters that are namespaced:

---

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

an ingress needs apiversion, kind, metadata and spec fields.
the name of an ingress object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
for general information about working with config files, see deploying applications , configuring containers , managing resources .
ingress frequently uses annotations to configure some options depending on the ingress controller, an example of which is the rewrite-target annotation .
different ingress controllers  support different annotations.
review the documentation for your choice of ingress controller to learn which annotations are supported.
the ingress spec  has all the information needed to configure a load balancer or proxy server.
most importantly, it contains a list of rules matched against all incoming requests.
ingress resource only supports rules for directing http(s) traffic.
if the ingressclassname is omitted, a default ingress class  should be defined.
there are some ingress controllers, that work without the definition of a default ingressclass.
for example, the ingress-nginx controller can be configured with a flag  --watch-ingress-without-class.
it is recommended  though, to specify the default ingressclass as shown below .
ingress rules each http rule contains the following information: an optional host.
in this example, no host is specified, so the rule applies to all inbound http traffic through the ip address specified.
if a host is provided (for example, foo.bar.com), the rules apply to that host.
a list of paths (for example, /testpath), each of which has an associated backend defined with a

service.name

and a

service.port.name

or

service.port.number

.
both the host and path must match the content of an incoming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced service.
a backend is a combination of service and port names as described in the service doc  or a custom resource backend  by way of a crd .
http (and https) requests to the ingress that match the host and path of the rule are sent to the listed backend.
a defaultbackend is often configured in an ingress controller to service any requests that do not match a path in the spec.
defaultbackend an ingress with no rules sends all traffic to a single default backend and

.spec.defaultbackend

is the backend that should handle requests in that case.
the defaultbackend is conventionally a configuration option of the ingress controller  and is not specified in your ingress resources.
if no

.spec.rules

are specified,

.spec.defaultbackend

must be specified.
if defaultbackend is not set, the handling of requests that do not match any of the rules will be up to the ingress controller (consult the documentation for your ingress controller to find out how it handles this case).
if none of the hosts or paths match the http request in the ingress objects, the traffic is routed to your default backend.
resource backends a resource backend is an objectref to another kubernetes resource within the same namespace as the ingress object.
a resource is a mutually exclusive setting with service, and will fail validation if both are specified.
a common usage for a resource backend is to ingress data to an object storage backend with static assets.

The controller name for the Nginx Ingress Controller should be set to `k8s.io/ingress-nginx` instead of `example.com/ingress-controller`.

```

### Explanation
The first label is designated for the deployment itself, providing a specific label for that deployment. For instance, if you wish to delete the deployment, you can execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment -l app=nginx
```

This command will remove the entire deployment.

The second label is the selector, specifically `matchLabels`, which instructs resources (like services) to match pods based on their labels. For example, if you want to create a service that targets all pods labeled with `app=nginx`, you would use the definition provided above.

The service will search for the specified `matchLabels` and bind to the pods that have the label `app: nginx` assigned to them.

The third label pertains to the pod template labels. The template refers to the pod template that describes the pods to be launched. For instance, if you have a deployment with two replicas, Kubernetes will create two pods with the labels specified in the template's `metadata.labels`. This distinction is subtle but significant, as it allows for different labels for the deployment and the pods generated by that deployment.","the following is an example of a deployment.
it creates a replicaset to bring up three nginx pods: controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml 

apiversion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchlabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerport: 80

in this example: a deployment named nginx-deployment is created, indicated by the

.metadata.name

field.
this name will become the basis for the replicasets and pods which are created later.
see writing a deployment spec  for more details.
the deployment creates a replicaset that creates three replicated pods, indicated by the

.spec.replicas

field.
the

.spec.selector

field defines how the created replicaset finds which pods to manage.
in this case, you select a label that is defined in the pod template (app: nginx).
however, more sophisticated selection rules are possible, as long as the pod template itself satisfies the rule.
note: the

.spec.selector.matchlabels

field is a map of {key,value} pairs.
a single {key,value} in the matchlabels map is equivalent to an element of matchexpressions, whose key field is ""key"", the operator is ""in"", and the values array contains only ""value"".
all of the requirements, from both matchlabels and matchexpressions, must be satisfied in order to match.
the

.spec.template

field contains the following sub-fields: the pods are labeled app: nginxusing the

.metadata.labels

field.
the pod template's specification, or

.spec

field, indicates that the pods run one container, nginx, which runs the nginx docker hub  image at version 1.14.2.
create one container and name it nginx using the

.spec.containers[0].name

field.
before you begin, make sure your kubernetes cluster is up and running.
follow the steps given below to create the above deployment: create the deployment by running the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml

run

kubectl get deployments

to check if the deployment was created.
if the deployment is still being created, the output is similar to the following:

name               ready   up-to-date   available   age
nginx-deployment   0/3     0            0           1s

when you inspect the deployments in your cluster, the following fields are displayed: name lists the names of the deployments in the namespace.
ready displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
it follows the pattern ready/desired.
up-to-date displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
available displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
age displays the amount of time that the application has been running.
notice how the number of desired replicas is 3 according to

.spec.replicas

field.
to see the deployment rollout status, run

kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

.
the output is similar to:

waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
deployment ""nginx-deployment"" successfully rolled out

run the

kubectl get deployments

again a few seconds later.
the output is similar to this:

notice that the deployment has created all three replicas, and all replicas are up-to-date (they contain the latest pod template) and available.
to see the replicaset (rs) created by the deployment, run

kubectl get rs

.
the output is similar to this:

### Explanation
Secrets are designed to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords and private keys, while ConfigMaps are intended for non-sensitive configuration data. According to the documentation, a Secret is an object that holds a small amount of sensitive data, like a password, token, or key. On the other hand, a ConfigMap allows you to separate environment-specific configurations from your container images, making your applications more portable.

You can create a Secret and mount it as one or more files in your Pods. Below is a simple example demonstrating how this works. The sample includes a Secret manifest file and a Deployment that utilizes this Secret. Note that I used `subPath` with the Secrets, and it functions as expected.

Before deploying, ensure that the Secret is created. After creating both the Secret and Deployment, you can verify their functionality with the following commands:

```bash
$ kubectl get secret,deploy,pod
```

This will show the status of the Secret, Deployment, and Pod. You can also check the contents of the mounted files using:

```bash
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- ls /mnt
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat /mnt/secret.file1
$ kubectl exec <pod-name> -- cat /mnt/secret.file2
```

### Projected Volume
A more effective approach to achieve your goal is to use a projected volume. A projected volume allows you to map multiple existing volume sources into the same directory. The documentation provides a detailed explanation, but I have also created an example to illustrate how it works. In this example, I mounted `secret.file1`, `secret.file2` from a Secret, and `config.file1` from a ConfigMap as files within the Pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
data:
  secret.file1: |
    c2vjcmv0rmlsztek
  secret.file2: |
    c2vjcmv0rmlsztik

metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: all-in-one
      mountPath: ""/config-volume""
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: my-secret
          items:
            - key: secret.file1
              path: secret-dir1/secret.file1
            - key: secret.file2
              path: secret-dir2/secret.file2
      - configMap:
          name: my-config
          items:
            - key: config.file1
              path: config-dir1/config.file1
```

You can verify the functionality of this setup with the following commands:

```bash
$ kubectl exec nginx -- ls /config-volume
$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/config-dir1/config.file1
$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/secret-dir1/secret.file1
$ kubectl exec nginx -- cat /config-volume/secret-dir2/secret.file2
```

If this response does not address your question, please provide more details about your Secret and your specific objectives.","here is a configuration file you can use to create a pod: pods/inject/secret-pod.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: secret-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test-container
      image: nginx
      volumemounts:
        # name must match the volume name below
        - name: secret-volume
          mountpath: /etc/secret-volume
          readonly: true
  # the secret data is exposed to containers in the pod through a volume.
  volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretname: test-secret

create the pod:

kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/secret-pod.yaml

verify that your pod is running:

kubectl get pod secret-test-pod

output:

name              ready     status    restarts   age
secret-test-pod   1/1       running   0          42m

get a shell into the container that is running in your pod:

kubectl exec -i -t secret-test-pod -- /bin/bash

the secret data is exposed to the container through a volume mounted under /etc/secret-volume.
in your shell, list the files in the /etc/secret-volume directory:

# run this in the shell inside the container
ls /etc/secret-volume

the output shows two files, one for each piece of secret data: password username in your shell, display the contents of the username and password files:

# run this in the shell inside the container
echo ""$( cat /etc/secret-volume/username )""
echo ""$( cat /etc/secret-volume/password )""

the output is your username and password: my-app 39528$vdg7jb modify your image or command line so that the program looks for files in the mountpath directory.
each key in the secret data map becomes a file name in this directory.
project secret keys to specific file paths you can also control the paths within the volume where secret keys are projected.
use the

.spec.volumes[].secret.items

field to change the target path of each key:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      items:
      - key: username
        path: my-group/my-username

when you deploy this pod, the following happens: the username key from mysecret is available to the container at the path /etc/foo/my-group/my-username instead of at /etc/foo/username.
the password key from that secret object is not projected.
if you list keys explicitly using

.spec.volumes[].secret.items

, consider the following: only keys specified in items are projected.
to consume all keys from the secret, all of them must be listed in the items field.
all listed keys must exist in the corresponding secret.
otherwise, the volume is not created.
set posix permissions for secret keys you can set the posix file access permission bits for a single secret key.
if you don't specify any permissions, 0644 is used by default.
you can also set a default posix file mode for the entire secret volume, and you can override per key if needed.
for example, you can specify a default mode like this:

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      defaultmode: 0400

the secret is mounted on /etc/foo; all the files created by the secret volume mount have permission 0400.
note: if you're defining a pod or a pod template using json, beware that the json specification doesn't support octal literals for numbers because json considers 0400 to be the decimal value 400.
in json, use decimal values for the defaultmode instead.
if you're writing yaml, you can write the defaultmode in octal.
========================================","creating a secret there are several options to create a secret: use kubectl  use a configuration file  use the kustomize tool  constraints on secret names and data the name of a secret object must be a valid dns subdomain name .
you can specify the data and/or the stringdata field when creating a configuration file for a secret.
the data and the stringdata fields are optional.
the values for all keys in the data field have to be base64-encoded strings.
if the conversion to base64 string is not desirable, you can choose to specify the stringdata field instead, which accepts arbitrary strings as values.
the keys of data and stringdata must consist of alphanumeric characters, -, _ or

.

.
all key-value pairs in the stringdata field are internally merged into the data field.
if a key appears in both the data and the stringdata field, the value specified in the stringdata field takes precedence.
size limit individual secrets are limited to 1mib in size.
this is to discourage creation of very large secrets that could exhaust the api server and kubelet memory.
however, creation of many smaller secrets could also exhaust memory.
you can use a resource quota  to limit the number of secrets (or other resources) in a namespace.
editing a secret you can edit an existing secret unless it is immutable .
to edit a secret, use one of the following methods: use kubectl  use a configuration file  you can also edit the data in a secret using the kustomize tool .
however, this method creates a new secret object with the edited data.
depending on how you created the secret, as well as how the secret is used in your pods, updates to existing secret objects are propagated automatically to pods that use the data.
for more information, refer to using secrets as files from a pod  section.
using a secret secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables  to be used by a container in a pod.
secrets can also be used by other parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the pod.
for example, secrets can hold credentials that other parts of the system should use to interact with external systems on your behalf.
secret volume sources are validated to ensure that the specified object reference actually points to an object of type secret.
therefore, a secret needs to be created before any pods that depend on it.
if the secret cannot be fetched (perhaps because it does not exist, or due to a temporary lack of connection to the api server) the kubelet periodically retries running that pod.
the kubelet also reports an event for that pod, including details of the problem fetching the secret.
optional secrets when you reference a secret in a pod, you can mark the secret as optional , such as in the following example.
if an optional secret doesn't exist, kubernetes ignores it.
secret/optional-secret.yaml 

apiversion: v1
kind: pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumemounts:
    - name: foo
      mountpath: ""/etc/foo""
      readonly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    secret:
      secretname: mysecret
      optional: true

by default, secrets are required.
none of a pod's containers will start until all non-optional secrets are available.
if a pod references a specific key in a non-optional secret and that secret does exist, but is missing the named key, the pod fails during startup.
using secrets as files from a pod if you want to access data from a secret in a pod, one way to do that is to have kubernetes make the value of that secret be available as a file inside the filesystem of one or more of the pod's containers.
for instructions, refer to create a pod that has access to the secret data through a volume .
when a volume contains data from a secret, and that secret is updated, kubernetes tracks this and updates the data in the volume, using an eventually-consistent approach.
note: a container using a secret as a subpath  volume mount does not receive automated secret updates.
the kubelet keeps a cache of the curren","you can use secrets for purposes such as the following: set environment variables for a container .
provide credentials such as ssh keys or passwords to pods .
allow the kubelet to pull container images from private registries .
the kubernetes control plane also uses secrets; for example, bootstrap token secrets  are a mechanism to help automate node registration.
use case: dotfiles in a secret volume you can make your data ""hidden"" by defining a key that begins with a dot.
this key represents a dotfile or ""hidden"" file.
for example, when the following secret is mounted into a volume, secret-volume, the volume will contain a single file, called

.secret-file

, and the dotfile-test-container will have this file present at the path

/etc/secret-volume/.secret-file

.
note: files beginning with dot characters are hidden from the output of ls -l; you must use ls -la to see them when listing directory contents.

      volumemounts:
        - name: secret-volume
          readonly: true
          mountpath: ""/etc/secret-volume""

use case: secret visible to one container in a pod consider a program that needs to handle http requests, do some complex business logic, and then sign some messages with an hmac.
because it has complex application logic, there might be an unnoticed remote file reading exploit in the server, which could expose the private key to an attacker.
this could be divided into two processes in two containers: a frontend container which handles user interaction and business logic, but which cannot see the private key; and a signer container that can see the private key, and responds to simple signing requests from the frontend (for example, over localhost networking).
with this partitioned approach, an attacker now has to trick the application server into doing something rather arbitrary, which may be harder than getting it to read a file.
alternatives to secrets rather than using a secret to protect confidential data, you can pick from alternatives.
here are some of your options: if your cloud-native component needs to authenticate to another application that you know is running within the same kubernetes cluster, you can use a serviceaccount  and its tokens to identify your client.
there are third-party tools that you can run, either within or outside your cluster, that manage sensitive data.
for example, a service that pods access over https, that reveals a secret if the client correctly authenticates (for example, with a serviceaccount token).
for authentication, you can implement a custom signer for x.509 certificates, and use certificatesigningrequests  to let that custom signer issue certificates to pods that need them.
you can use a device plugin  to expose node-local encryption hardware to a specific pod.
for example, you can schedule trusted pods onto nodes that provide a trusted platform module, configured out-of-band.
you can also combine two or more of those options, including the option to use secret objects themselves.
for example: implement (or deploy) an operator  that fetches short-lived session tokens from an external service, and then creates secrets based on those short-lived session tokens.
pods running in your cluster can make use of the session tokens, and operator ensures they are valid.
this separation means that you can run pods that are unaware of the exact mechanisms for issuing and refreshing those session tokens.

for example, you can schedule trusted pods onto nodes that provide a trusted platform module, configured out-of-band.
you can also combine two or more of those options, including the option to use secret objects themselves.
for example: implement (or deploy) an operator  that fetches short-lived session tokens from an external service, and then creates secrets based on those short-lived session tokens.
pods running in your cluster can make use of the session tokens, and operator ensures they are valid.
this separation means that you can run pods that are unaware of the exact mechanisms for issuing and refreshing those session tokens.

This allows you to mount a specific key from the secret as a file at the desired path. The provided configuration aligns with Kubernetes best practices for mounting secrets and config maps.","1490.0, 484.0, 482.0","[1,3]"
