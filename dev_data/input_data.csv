2,"Since your application ""real"" root is /my/new/context, you can rewrite every incoming request matching the /dev/jira URI using Nginx's AppRoot:

If the Application Root is exposed in a different path and needs to be redirected, set the annotation nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root to redirect requests for /.

If you're using this approach, there is no need to use capture groups with rewrite-target.

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1

      - path: /prod/jira(/|$)(.*)
        backend:
          serviceName: jira
          servicePort: 80","Based on the provided context and the issue of the context path of the Tomcat server, the NGINX Ingress annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root` should be used to redirect requests from the root path `/` to the context path of the application `/my/new/context`. The Ingress configuration should be adjusted to include this annotation so that all incoming requests are properly directed to the Tomcat server running at the specified context path.

Here is the corrected Ingress YAML configuration:

```yaml

Based on the provided context, there is no direct way to achieve a redirection from an ingress hostpath to a subpath on the backend using standard Kubernetes Ingress resources. However, you can use NGINX annotations to rewrite the incoming requests to the desired subpath on the backend service.

Here is an example YAML configuration with annotations to achieve a rewrite for the described scenario:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: jupyter-notebook-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2

```",Y,,"### **Key Points:**
1. Create an Ingress rule with an app-root annotation to redirect requests to a specific path: ```nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root: /app1```.
2. Create an Ingress rule with a rewrite annotation to modify the request path based on captured groups: ```nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2```.","### **Key Points:**
1. Use NGINX annotations to rewrite incoming requests to a desired subpath on the backend service, with the code snippet:

2. Configure the Ingress resource with regex support and specify the backend service, as shown in the following YAML:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress

   ```"
4,"As you mentioned, there is no error in the log files, and everything looks normal from your perspective. I may suggest to tune up ingress using annotations tags. I've checked documentation of ingress-nginx and found that below annotations may help a bit.

In some scenarios, the exposed URL in the backend service differs from the specified path in the Ingress rule. Without a rewrite, any request will return 404. Set the annotation

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target
to the path expected by the service.

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /

      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: http-svc
          servicePort: 80
        path: /something
If the Application Root is exposed in a different path and needs to be redirected, set the annotation

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root
to redirect requests for /.

        path: /
If the application contains relative links, it is possible to add an additional annotation

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/add-base-url
that will prepend a base tag in the header of the returned HTML from the backend.","Based on the provided context and the issues in the configuration, here is the validated YAML configuration for the Ingress to handle subpaths correctly:

To address this issue and ensure proper redirection, you need to make changes to the Ingress definition annotations in such a way that requests to `/category/` get redirected correctly.

Below is a validated and comprehensive response to resolve the issue and optimize the Ingress resource configuration:

### Ingress Definition:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: spare-ingress-dev
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx

                port:
                  number: 5200
```

### Service Definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cluster-category-ip
spec:
  selector:
    app: category
  ports:
    - port: 5200
      targetPort: 5200
```",Y,,"### **Key Points:**
1. Configure Ingress with regex support and app-root annotation by adding the following annotations: 
   ```yaml
   kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/app-root: /
   ```
2. Define multiple paths for the Ingress rules to route traffic to different services based on the URL pattern:
   ```yaml
   - path: /api/v1.0/auth/(.+)
     backend:
       serviceName: cluster-auth-ip
       servicePort: 6000
   - path: /api/v1.0/category/(.+)
     backend:
       serviceName: cluster-category-ip
       servicePort: 5200
   - path: /category/(.+)
     backend:
       serviceName: cluster-category-ip
       servicePort: 5200
   ```","### **Key Points:**
1. Update the Ingress definition to include the correct rewrite-target and use-regex annotations for proper path redirection: 
   ```yaml
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
   ```
2. Define the Ingress resource with specific paths for redirection, ensuring that requests to `/category/` are routed to the appropriate backend service:
   ```yaml
   - path: /category(/|$)(.*)
     backend:
       service:
         name: cluster-category-ip
         port:
           number: 5200

Here is the validated YAML configuration for the Ingress resource:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:

  ingressClassName: nginx
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
```

Explanation:
- In the `paths` section of the Ingress resource, the `/test(/|$)(.*)` regex pattern captures any characters after `/test` (including an empty string) into the placeholder `$2`.
- The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2` annotation then rewrites the URI to exclude `/test` before forwarding the request to the backend service.

Potential issue:
- The provided context highlights the missing `pathType` in the Ingress configuration. Ensure that `pathType: ImplementationSpecific` is specified for the specific path to adhere to current best practices.

Debugging and troubleshooting steps:
1. Apply the above YAML configuration using `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`.
2. Send a test request to the endpoint `/abc` using `http://ip-address/abc` to verify that the rewrite rule is successful.
3. Monitor the NGINX Ingress Controller logs for any errors or warnings related to the rewrite functionality.
4. Use `kubectl describe ingress load-balancer` to check the applied annotations and paths to ensure they match the intended configuration.
5. If issues persist, review NGINX Ingress Controller logs and NGINX configuration to troubleshoot further.

1. Ingress route
2. SignalR with LoadBalancer
Ingress route
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
Rewrite has $1 it means to place first capturing group, but what is it? Well it's something that can be used only when nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex is added, so it just doesn't make sens, when request is send to get for file like /styles.css it would end up with something like /$1styles.css in Blazor app or anything else but not valid from your app point of view.

You can have for example

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: blazor-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: ""cookie""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: ""affinity""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-expires: ""14400""

                  number: 80
And everything should work, but rewrite /(path: /) to /(rewrite-target: / end with what we had at beginning, so removing line with rewrite-target has exactly same effect.

Another example using regex

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: blazor-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1

    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-expires: ""14400""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-max-age: ""14400""
spec:
  rules:
    - host: blazor.test
      http:
        paths:

                  number: 80
In this case in path we have /(.*) and we have one capturing group what is (.*)(to make path / work correctly you must have * instead of +), then rewrite comes in and it says /$1 as we have regex enabled in place of $1 the value stored in first capturing group will be used here.","Based on the provided context and the issues faced with the Blazor Server app deployment on Kubernetes, I will provide corrected and enhanced YAML configurations with appropriate annotations:

Deployment YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: blazor
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: blazor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: blazor
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: blazor
        image: registry/...
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        imagePullSecrets:
        - name: test-webapp
```

Service YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: blazor
  name: blazor
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30500
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: blazor
  type: NodePort
```

Ingress YAML:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: blazor-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: cookie
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: affinity
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-expires: ""14400""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-max-age: ""14400""
spec:
  rules:
  - host: blazor.test
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: blazor
            port:
              number: 80
```

Explanation:
1. The Deployment YAML defines the pod template for the Blazor application with the necessary configurations.
2. The Service YAML exposes the Deployment internally and maps the container port to the service port, allowing inter-pod communication.
3. The Ingress YAML configures how external traffic is routed to the Blazor app using the specified annotations for session cookie management and rewriting target paths.

Potential Issues:
1. The provided Ingress YAML lacks the `pathType` field, which is essential for defining how paths should be matched. I have added `pathType: Prefix` assuming this is the desired behavior. Adjust it based on the specific routing needs.

Debugging Steps:
1. Verify the service and pods are running correctly.
2. Check network policies to ensure traffic flow.
3. Use `kubectl describe <resource>` commands to troubleshoot the resources.
4. Investigate Ingress controller logs for potential routing issues.
5. Ensure WebSocket protocols are correctly enabled in the Ingress controller configuration.

By implementing the corrected YAML configurations and following the suggested debugging steps, you should be able to address the issues faced with deploying the Blazor Server app on Kubernetes.
",Y,,"### **Key Points:**
1. To configure an Ingress route for a Blazor app without regex, use the following annotations to ensure proper session handling and rewrite behavior:
   ```yaml
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: ""cookie""
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: ""affinity""
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-expires: ""14400""
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-max-age: ""14400""
   ```

2. For an Ingress route using regex, enable regex support and define a capturing group in the path to correctly rewrite requests:
   ```yaml
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
   nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
   ```","### **Key Points:**
1. **Deployment Configuration**: Define a Deployment for the Blazor application with 3 replicas and necessary container settings.  
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: blazor
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: blazor
     template:
       metadata:

           - containerPort: 80
           imagePullSecrets:
           - name: test-webapp
   ```

2. **Service Exposure**: Create a Service of type NodePort to expose the Blazor application, mapping the container port to a node port for external access.  
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: blazor

       protocol: TCP
       targetPort: 80
     selector:
       app: blazor
     type: NodePort
   ```

3. **Ingress Configuration**: Set up an Ingress resource with annotations for session management and path rewriting to route external traffic to the Blazor app. Ensure to include `pathType: Prefix`.  
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: blazor-ingress
     annotations:
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: cookie
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: affinity
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-expires: ""14400""
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-max-age: ""14400""
   spec:
     rules:

               port:
                 number: 80
   ```

4. **Debugging Steps**: Verify the deployment and service status, check network policies, and investigate Ingress controller logs for routing issues.  
   - Use `kubectl describe <resource>` for troubleshooting.
   - Ensure WebSocket protocols are enabled in the Ingress controller configuration."

If you have a better answer the kindly add a new answer on the question.","To enable HTTP to HTTPS redirection for your ASP.NET Core application running in a Kubernetes cluster, you need to configure the NGINX Ingress controller to perform the redirection. Since the redirection logic in your ASP.NET Core application (`app.UseHttpsRedirection()`) doesn't work when running behind the Ingress controller, you should handle the redirection at the Ingress controller level.

Here's how you can update your Ingress resource to handle HTTP to HTTPS redirection:

Explanation:
1. `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""https""`: This annotation instructs NGINX Ingress to communicate with the backend service over HTTPS protocol. This aligns with the requirement of enabling HTTPS communication between the load balancer and the backend service.

Rationale:
- The annotation ensures that NGINX Ingress communicates with the backend service using HTTPS, enhancing security and confidentiality.
- By setting the backend protocol to HTTPS, the controller will establish secure communication with the backend service, ensuring encrypted data exchange.

Potential issue:
- Ensure that the NGINX Ingress Controller supports the `backend-protocol` annotation. This annotation should be valid and recognized by the Ingress controller being used.

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Apply the updated Ingress configuration with the `backend-protocol` annotation.
2. Check the NGINX Ingress Controller logs for any errors related to the HTTPS backend configuration.
3. Verify the communication between the load balancer and the backend service using tools like `curl` or `kubectl exec`.
4. Monitor the NGINX Ingress Controller's behavior to ensure that it is establishing HTTPS communication with the backend service.

The ingress controller supports case insensitive regular expressions in the spec.rules.http.paths.path field. This can be enabled by setting the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex annotation to true (the default is false).

The example they provide on the page would cover it:

To set up a Kubernetes Ingress rule with a regex path, you need to ensure that you use the correct annotations and configuration. Below is the validated solution with corrected annotations and explanations:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cafe-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
spec:
  rules:
  - host: cafe.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: ImplementationSpecific
        path: /t([a-z])a
        backend:
          service:
            name: tea-svc
            port:
              number: 80
      - pathType: ImplementationSpecific
        path: /coffee
        backend:
          service:
            name: coffee-svc
            port:
              number: 80
```

### Rationale and Explanations:
1. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""` annotation is required to enable the use of regular expressions in the path matching.
2. The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1` annotation captures the matching group defined by the regex and rewrites the URI accordingly.
3. In the `paths` section, each path should have a `pathType` set to `ImplementationSpecific` to define that the path is using a custom implementation-specific logic.

### Potential Issues and Assumptions:
1. The provided YAML was missing the `pathType` field, which is crucial for ingress configurations with regex paths. Ensure that this field is correctly set based on the requirement.
2. The usage of regex paths in Ingress rules might sometimes lead to unexpected routing behavior. Validating the regex pattern is essential to ensure correct path matching.

### Debugging Steps:
1. Apply the updated Ingress YAML using `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml`.
2. Verify the Ingress using `kubectl get ingress cafe-ingress -o wide` to check if the Ingress rule is applied correctly.
3. Test access to the specified paths using a tool like `curl` to confirm that the regex path matching is working as expected.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up a Kubernetes Ingress rule with a regex path using the nginx ingress controller effectively.",Y,,"### **Key Points:**
1. Enable case insensitive regular expressions in Ingress by setting the annotation: ```nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""```.

3. Set the `pathType` to `ImplementationSpecific` for each path in the Ingress configuration."
17,"limit-rps is a local rate limit settings that is applied on a specific ingress object rather than in a config map provided to the ingress controller.

It will limit the number of requests per second from an IP adress:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: number of requests accepted from a given IP each second. The burst limit is set to this limit multiplied by the burst multiplier, the default multiplier is 5. When clients exceed this limit, limit-req-status-code default: 503 is returned.

Please se below for a dummy example. As you can see nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: 10 is added under metadata.annotations on the ingress object

  name: hop-ingress
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: ""nginx""
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: ""10"" # Set the limit to 10 requests per second

                  number: 80
```

Explanation:
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: ""10""`: Sets the rate limit to 10 requests per second.
- `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-burst-multiplier: ""5""`: Sets the burst multiplier to 5, which means the burst limit will be 10 * 5 = 50 requests.
- The `path` field under the `http` section defines the path for which the rate limiting will be applied.

Potential Issues or Critical Assumptions:
- The rate-limiting configuration in the Ingress resource is relying on NGINX Ingress Controller to apply those settings. Ensure that your NGINX Ingress Controller supports and is configured correctly to handle rate limiting.
- The user might need to verify that there are no conflicting annotations or configurations that could override the rate limiting settings.

Debugging and Troubleshooting:
1. Ensure that the NGINX Ingress Controller is running and healthy.
2. Check the NGINX Ingress Controller logs for any errors or warnings related to rate limiting configuration.
3. Test the rate limiting behavior by sending requests at a higher rate than the configured limit and verifying if requests are being limited as expected.
4. Consider using tools like `curl` with the appropriate headers to test the rate limiting behavior and analyze the response codes.
5. Check the NGINX Ingress Controller documentation for any specific troubleshooting steps related to rate limiting configurations.

By following these steps, the user should be able to effectively apply rate limiting using NGINX Ingress in their AKS environment.",Y,,"### **Key Points:**
1. Apply local rate limiting on an Ingress object using the annotation, ```nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: 10```, to limit requests to 10 per second from a single IP address.

19,"For the first question, you can use regex in your paths without any problem, you just need to annotate the ingress with the use-regex, at least according to the documentation (https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/#use-regex)

Something like:

metadata:
  name: your-name
    annotations:
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
  spec:
    ...
or as an alternative, if you use the annotation for rewrite target, the regex should also be enforced.

As for the regex to use, in order to match the start of a path, for example all paths starting with something, like something_first or something_another, you could go for the simple:

For the second question I'm not sure of what you are asking, exactly. The Ingress is supposed to be used with http or https requests and those should provide a path. If you want to simply expose a service outside at a given port, you could go for a LoadBalancer service.

Internally, the service you want to access with just a port answers in http at the root path? Or does something different? If it answers only at the root path, you could match all paths in the request to the root path.

As for how you could make all paths of the request rewrite to root, you could go with a rewrite annotation, such as:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
For more info on this annotation, check the documentation because it can do a lot of things (https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/rewrite/)

Also take in mind that if you want to rewrite two services in two different places, you need to split the Ingress into two separate ingresses

Follow","To address your three issues with the Ingress configurations in YAML format based on the provided information, here are the annotations you can use:

1. Correctly implement regex to match the first part of a path in Ingress:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: search-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /^\/search_[0-9A-Z]{9}
        backend:
          serviceName: global-search-service
          servicePort: 5050
```

2. Access a service with no path, just port using an iframe:
If you just need to access the service by port, without specifying a path, you can use the following configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: chart-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:

20,"TL;DR
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
path: /webservice($|/)(.*)
Explanation
The problem is from that line in your ingress:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /

You're telling nginx to rewrite your url to / whatever it matched.

/webservice => /
/webservice/data/office/getOffice => /
To do what you're trying to do use regex, here is a simple example:

 apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
 kind: Ingress
 metadata:
   name: stack-ingress
   annotations:
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
  spec:
   rules:
    - host: hello-world.info
    - http:
        paths:
        - path: /
          backend:
            serviceName: service-ngstack --> frondend
            servicePort: 80
        - path: /webservice($|/)(.*)
          backend:
            serviceName: service-wsstack --> backend
            servicePort: 80
This way you're asking nginx to rewrite your url with the second matching group. Finally it gives you:

/webservice => /
/webservice/data/office/getOffice => /data/office/getOffice","Based on the provided information and the issue you are facing, it seems that the path routing in the Ingress controller is not correctly redirecting the requests to the backend service. To fix this issue and properly route requests to the NodeJs backend service running on `/webservice`, you can use NGINX Ingress annotations for path rewriting.

Here is the updated Ingress configuration with the necessary annotations to properly route the requests:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: stack-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""
spec:
  rules:
  - host: hello-world.info
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /webservice(/|$)(.*)
        backend:
          serviceName: service-wsstack
          servicePort: 80
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: service-ngstack
          servicePort: 80
```

In this configuration:
- The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target` annotation uses `$2` as a placeholder to capture the remaining part of the URI after `/webservice`.
- The `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: ""true""` annotation enables regex matching for the path.
- The first path definition is for `/webservice`, which will route requests to the backend service `service-wsstack`.
- The second path definition is for `/`, which will route requests to the frontend service `service-ngstack`.

Applying this updated Ingress definition should redirect `/webservice` requests to the backend service as expected.

You can apply this configuration using the `kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml` command. After applying the changes, test the endpoints again with `curl` to ensure the routing is working correctly.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask for help.",Y,,"### **Key Points:**
1. Use regex in the rewrite annotation to capture the second matching group for URL rewriting. Code snippet: ```nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2```.

### Detailed Answer:

1. The ingress definition is missing the `pathType` field within the `paths` definition, which can lead to unexpected behavior. The `pathType` field should be set to `ImplementationSpecific` since the behavior implemented by NGINX ingress classifies it as such.

2. Since the original configuration does not use the rewrite annotation, the routing rules might not match the backend service paths properly.

3. To address the issue and correctly direct traffic to the respective services, the following annotations and adjustments should be made:

Backend Protocol
Using backend-protocol annotations is possible to indicate how NGINX should communicate with the backend service. (Replaces secure-backends in older versions) Valid Values: HTTP, HTTPS, GRPC, GRPCS and AJP

By default NGINX uses HTTP.

Example:

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""HTTPS""

As an aside, there's a chance you might need to specify GRPCS instead of GRPC since it appears you are using SSL.

If you want to use load balancing mechanisms in k8s you should use services instead and start multiple instances behind that service that way k8s will do the load balancing. If you want to use different versions of your backend (e.g. prod and test) your way of separating them is fine

if your service is only reachable via https you need to add the following annotation to your ingress yaml: (documentation)

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: ""HTTPS""
To secure ingress itself take a look at this: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls

But if you want that the backend services decrypt the TLS communication use the following annotation instead: (documentation)

nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: ""true""

The Ingress YAML should look like this if you want to reach the backend via TLS:

Using backend-protocol annotations is possible to indicate how NGINX should communicate with the backend service. (Replaces secure-backends in older versions) Valid Values: HTTP, HTTPS, GRPC, GRPCS, AJP and FCGI

30,"You can use following command to delete the POD forcefully.

<code>kubectl delete pod &lt;PODNAME&gt; --grace-period=0 --force --namespace
</code>","### Common Reasons for Pods Stuck in Terminating Status

1. **Node Issues**: If the node where the pods are running is experiencing issues (e.g., network connectivity problems, not enough resources, kubelet not responding), it might fail to delete the pods.

2. **Finalizers**: Pods might have finalizers that are preventing them from being deleted immediately. Finalizers are mechanisms in Kubernetes that allow you to perform cleanup tasks before the resource is fully deleted.

3. **Resource Quotas and Limits**: If there are resource constraints, the operations related to pod deletion might not be prioritized or could be delayed.

4. **Kubernetes Bugs or Version Issues**: Sometimes specific versions of Kubernetes might have bugs that cause unexpected behavior including issues with terminating pods.

### Steps to Troubleshoot and Resolve

#### Step 1: Check Node Health
Ensure that the nodes are healthy and are able to communicate with the Kubernetes control plane. You can check the status of the nodes using:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
If any node is in a `NotReady` state, investigate the kubelet logs on that node:
```bash
journalctl -u kubelet
```

#### Step 2: Inspect the Pod and Check for Finalizers
Check if the pods have any finalizers that might be blocking their deletion:
```bash
kubectl get pod pod-186o2 -o json | jq '.metadata.finalizers'
```
If there are finalizers that are no longer needed or are causing issues, you can remove them manually:
```bash
kubectl patch pod pod-186o2 -p '{""metadata"":{""finalizers"":null}}'
```

#### Step 3: Force Delete the Pods
If the pods are still stuck and you've ruled out issues with finalizers and node health, you can try to force delete the pods:
```bash
kubectl delete pod pod-186o2 --grace-period=0 --force
```
This command tells Kubernetes to delete the pod immediately without waiting for confirmation from the kubelet that the pod has been terminated.

#### Step 4: Check for Kubernetes and Kubelet Logs
If the issue persists, check the logs for the Kubernetes control plane and kubelet to look for any errors or warnings that might indicate what is preventing the pods from terminating:
```bash
# Check kubelet logs
journalctl -u kubelet

# Check Kubernetes control plane logs (if accessible, depends on setup)
journalctl -u kube-apiserver
journalctl -u kube-controller-manager
```",Y,,"### **Key Points:**
1. To forcefully delete a POD, use the command: ```kubectl delete pod <PODNAME> --grace-period=0 --force --namespace```.","### **Key Points:**

   ```bash
   journalctl -u kubelet

2. **Inspect for Finalizers**: Check if pods have finalizers blocking deletion. Use:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pod pod-186o2 -o json | jq '.metadata.finalizers'
   ```
   To remove unnecessary finalizers, execute:
   ```bash
   kubectl patch pod pod-186o2 -p '{""metadata"":{""finalizers"":null}}'

3. **Force Delete Pods**: If pods remain stuck, force delete them with:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod pod-186o2 --grace-period=0 --force
   ```

4. **Check Logs for Errors**: If issues persist, review logs for errors. Check kubelet logs with:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u kubelet
   ```
   And Kubernetes control plane logs (if accessible) with:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u kube-apiserver
   journalctl -u kube-controller-manager

31,"As the handbook describes, you can reuse the Docker daemon from Minikube with eval $(minikube docker-env).
So to use an image without uploading it, you can follow these steps:

Set the environment variables with eval $(minikube docker-env)
Build the image with the Docker daemon of Minikube (e.g., docker build -t my-image .)
Set the image in the pod specification like the build tag (e.g., my-image)
Set the imagePullPolicy to Never, otherwise Kubernetes will try to download the image.

Important note: You have to run eval $(minikube docker-env) on each terminal you want to use, since it only sets the environment variables for the current shell session.","To use local Docker images directly with Minikube without needing to upload them to a registry, you can leverage Minikube's ability to reuse the Docker daemon. This approach simplifies the process as Minikube can directly use Docker images that are already built on your machine.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

### Step 1: Start Minikube with the Docker Driver

Ensure Minikube is using the Docker driver, which allows you to use Docker images directly from your local Docker daemon.

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment to Use Minikube's Docker Daemon

Run this command to configure your shell to use the Docker daemon inside the Minikube instance. This means any Docker command you run in this shell session will interact with Minikube  s Docker daemon.

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

### Step 3: Build or Pull Your Docker Images

Now, any Docker operations you perform will use Minikube's Docker environment. If you haven't already built your Docker images, you can build them now, and they will be directly available to Minikube:

```bash
docker build -t fluxcapacitor/hdfs:latest .
```

Or if you already have the image on your local machine, it's already accessible to Minikube after the previous step.

### Step 4: Create Kubernetes Deployments Using Local Images

When creating deployments in Kubernetes, set the `imagePullPolicy` to `Never` to force Kubernetes to use the local image rather than pulling it from a registry.

Here  s how you can run your Docker container in Minikube:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hdfs-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hdfs
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hdfs
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hdfs
        image: fluxcapacitor/hdfs:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8989
        imagePullPolicy: Never
```

Save this file as `deployment.yaml` and apply it with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Step 5: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of your pods to ensure that the deployment was successful and the pod is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods

3. Build or pull your Docker images within Minikube's Docker environment: ```docker build -t fluxcapacitor/hdfs:latest .```.

5. Verify the deployment by checking the status of your pods: ```kubectl get pods```."
32,"There is no command to do exactly what you asked.
Here are some close matches.
Be careful before running any of these commands.  Make sure you are connected to the right cluster, if you use multiple clusters.  Consider running. kubectl config view first.
You can delete all the pods in a single namespace with this command:
kubectl delete --all pods --namespace=foo

You can also delete all deployments in namespace which will delete all pods attached with the deployments corresponding to the namespace
kubectl delete --all deployments --namespace=foo

You can delete all namespaces and every object in every namespace (but not un-namespaced objects, like nodes and some events) with this command:
kubectl delete --all namespaces

However, the latter command is probably not something you want to do, since it will delete things in the kube-system namespace, which will make your cluster not usable.
This command will delete all the namespaces except kube-system, which might be useful:
for each in $(kubectl get ns -o jsonpath=&quot;{.items[*].metadata.name}&quot; | grep -v kube-system);
do
  kubectl delete ns $each
done
","To delete all pods in all namespaces using Kubernetes, you can use the `kubectl` command-line tool. This tool interacts with the Kubernetes API to manage the state of your Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, and deleting resources like pods.

Here's how you can delete all pods in all namespaces:

### Using kubectl Command

You can use the following command to delete all pods in all namespaces:

```bash
kubectl delete pods --all --all-namespaces
```

#### Explanation:

- `kubectl delete pods`: This command tells `kubectl` to delete resources of type pod.
- `--all`: This flag specifies that you want to delete all pods.
- `--all-namespaces`: This flag specifies that the operation should be performed across all namespaces.

### Important Considerations

1. **Impact on Applications**: Deleting all pods can have a significant impact on your applications running in the cluster. All stateless applications will face downtime until the pods are recreated (if they are managed by controllers like Deployments, StatefulSets, etc.). For stateful applications, you might lose data if not properly backed up or if they are not using persistent storage.

2. **Controllers and Orphaned Resources**: If the pods are managed by higher-level controllers like Deployments, ReplicaSets, or StatefulSets, these controllers might immediately try to recreate the pods after they are deleted. To prevent this, you might need to scale down these controllers before deleting the pods or consider deleting the controllers themselves if appropriate.

3. **Namespace Resources**: Deleting pods does not delete other resources in the namespaces, such as services, persistent volume claims, or secrets. You might need to clean up these resources separately if needed.

### Alternative: Deleting Specific Pods or Using Labels

If you need more control over which pods to delete, you can use label selectors to delete only the pods that match certain labels:

```bash
kubectl delete pods -l app=myapp --all-namespaces
```

Here, `-l app=myapp` specifies that only pods with the label `app=myapp` should be deleted across all namespaces.",Y,"Upon looking at the docs, there is an API call to delete a single pod, but is there a way to delete all pods in all namespaces?","### **Key Points:**
1. To delete all pods in a specific namespace, use: ```kubectl delete --all pods --namespace=foo```.
2. To delete all deployments in a namespace (which also deletes associated pods), use: ```kubectl delete --all deployments --namespace=foo```.
3. To delete all namespaces (with caution), use: ```kubectl delete --all namespaces```.
4. To delete all namespaces except kube-system, use the following loop:
   ```bash
   for each in $(kubectl get ns -o jsonpath=""{.items[*].metadata.name}"" | grep -v kube-system);
   do
     kubectl delete ns $each
   done

33,"You can switch from local (minikube) to gcloud and back with:

First, ensure that `kubectl` is configured to access both your local minikube cluster and your GKE cluster. You likely already have this setup for minikube, but you'll need to configure access to GKE as well.

For GKE, you can set up access using the following command:

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME] --zone [ZONE] --project [PROJECT_ID]
```

Replace `[CLUSTER_NAME]`, `[ZONE]`, and `[PROJECT_ID]` with your cluster's name, the zone where your cluster is located, and your Google Cloud project ID, respectively.

This command configures `kubectl` to communicate with your GKE cluster by updating the `kubeconfig` file, typically located at `~/.kube/config`.

### Step 2: Verify Contexts

After setting up access, you can check the available contexts using:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

This command will list all configured contexts. You should see both your minikube and GKE contexts listed.

### Step 3: Switching Contexts

To switch between your local minikube and GKE clusters, use the following `kubectl` command:

```bash
kubectl config use-context [CONTEXT_NAME]
```

Replace `[CONTEXT_NAME]` with the name of the context you want to switch to. You can find the context names from the output of the `get-contexts` command.

For example, if your minikube context is named `minikube` and your GKE context is named `gke_[PROJECT_ID]_[ZONE]_[CLUSTER_NAME]`, you can switch to the minikube context like this:

```bash
kubectl config use-context minikube
```

And switch to the GKE context like this:

```bash
kubectl config use-context gke_[PROJECT_ID]_[ZONE]_[CLUSTER_NAME]
```

### Step 4: Deploying YAML Files

Once you've switched to the desired context, you can apply your YAML files directly to the chosen cluster using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f [FILE_NAME]
```

Replace `[FILE_NAME]` with the path to your YAML file.",Y,"I have Kubernetes operating well in two different environments, namely in my local environment (MacBook running minikube) and as well as on Google's Container Engine (GCE, Kubernetes on Google Cloud). I use the MacBook/local environment to develop and test my YAML files and then, upon completion, try them on GCE.
Currently I need to work with each environment separately: I need to edit the YAML files in my local environment and, when ready, (git) clone them to a GCE environment and then use/deploy them.  This is a somewhat cumbersome process.
Ideally, I would like to use kubectl from my Macbook to easily change between the local minikube or GCE Kubernetes environments and to easily determine where the YAML files are used. Is there a simple way to switch contexts to do this?","### **Key Points:**
1. Switch between local (minikube) and gcloud contexts using: ```kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME```.
2. List all available contexts with: ```kubectl config get-contexts```.
3. Create separate YAML files for different environments for local and gcloud configurations.","### **Key Points:**

3. Switch between contexts using: ```kubectl config use-context [CONTEXT_NAME]```, replacing `[CONTEXT_NAME]` with the desired context name.
4. Deploy YAML files to the selected cluster with: ```kubectl apply -f [FILE_NAME]```, replacing `[FILE_NAME]` with the path to your YAML file."
34,"You need to delete the deployment, which should in turn delete the pods and the replica sets https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/24137
To list all deployments:
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces

Then to delete the deployment:
kubectl delete -n NAMESPACE deployment DEPLOYMENT

Where NAMESPACE is the namespace it's in, and DEPLOYMENT is the name of the deployment. If NAMESPACE is default, leave off the -n option altogether.
In some cases it could also be running due to a job or daemonset.
Check the following and run their appropriate delete command.
kubectl get jobs

kubectl get daemonsets.app --all-namespaces

kubectl get daemonsets.extensions --all-namespaces
","It appears that the issue you're encountering with the `busybox` pod continuously being recreated despite deletion attempts might be due to a higher-level controller that is managing the pod. In Kubernetes, such behavior is typically controlled by ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, or Deployments. Since you used the `kubectl run` command, it's possible that a Deployment or ReplicaSet was created automatically to manage the pod.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Identify the Controller
First, let's identify if there is a Deployment or ReplicaSet that is managing the pod. You can do this by checking for any Deployments or ReplicaSets in your namespace.

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get replicasets
```

### Step 2: Delete the Deployment or ReplicaSet
If you find a Deployment or ReplicaSet that seems to be managing your `busybox` pod, you should delete it. Deleting the Deployment or ReplicaSet will stop it from recreating the pod.

If it's a Deployment, delete it using:
```bash
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>
```

If it's a ReplicaSet, delete it using:
```bash
kubectl delete replicaset <replicaset-name>
```

Replace `<deployment-name>` or `<replicaset-name>` with the actual name of the Deployment or ReplicaSet managing your pod.

### Step 3: Delete Any Remaining Pods
After deleting the controlling object, you can then delete any remaining pods that were managed by it.

```bash
kubectl delete pod --selector=run=busybox --grace-period=0 --force
```

This command deletes all pods with the label `run=busybox`, which is typically set by the `kubectl run` command.

### Explanation
The reason why the pod keeps being recreated is likely due to a ReplicaSet or Deployment automatically created by the `kubectl run` command. In Kubernetes, these controllers are designed to maintain a set number of replicas of a pod, and they will recreate pods to maintain the desired state if pods are deleted or terminated unexpectedly.

By deleting the controller (Deployment or ReplicaSet), you remove the mechanism that Kubernetes uses to ensure the desired number of pods is running. Once the controller is deleted, you can then manually delete the pods without them being recreated.

### Additional Note
In newer versions of Kubernetes, the `--generator` flag used in your `kubectl run` command is deprecated. The `kubectl run` command now creates a pod directly without a Deployment unless specifically instructed to do otherwise. If you intend to create a Deployment using `kubectl run`, you should explicitly specify the kind of resource to create. For example:
```bash
kubectl create deployment busybox --image=busybox
```
This command creates a Deployment rather than a standalone pod.",Y,"I have started pods with command

35,"Those are two different approaches:
Imperative Management
kubectl create is what we call Imperative Management. On this approach you tell the Kubernetes API what you want to create, replace or delete, not how you want your K8s cluster world to look like.
Declarative Management
kubectl apply is part of the Declarative Management approach, where changes that you may have applied to a live object (i.e. through scale) are &quot;maintained&quot; even if you apply other changes to the object.

You can read more about imperative and declarative management in the Kubernetes Object Management documentation.

They do different things. If the resource exists, kubectl create will error out and kubectl apply will not error out.","The three operations you're referring to`kubectl create`, `kubectl replace`, and `kubectl apply`are indeed similar in that they all interact with resources in a Kubernetes cluster, but they serve different purposes and operate in distinct ways. Let's break down each command and discuss their use cases and how they differ under the hood.
?
### 1. `kubectl create`
**Purpose:** This command is used to create a new resource in a Kubernetes cluster. It takes a file or stdin that contains the configuration of the resource and creates it based on this specification.
?
**Use Case:** Use `kubectl create` when you need to create new resources in your cluster and you are sure that these resources do not exist. It's straightforward and explicit, making it ideal for initial setups and scripts where you want to ensure that resources are created from scratch.
?
**Under the Hood:** When you run `kubectl create`, Kubernetes takes the YAML or JSON definition, validates it, and then sends it to the API server which creates the resource. If the resource already exists, the command will fail.
?
**Example:**
```bash
kubectl create -f my-resource.yaml
```
?
### 2. `kubectl replace`
**Purpose:** This command replaces a resource in your cluster with a new version you specify. It requires that the resource already exists.
?
**Use Case:** Use `kubectl replace` when you need to forcefully replace an existing resource with a new one. This is useful for cases where you want to overwrite all the existing specifications of a resource with a new set of specifications.
?
**Under the Hood:** `kubectl replace` first deletes the existing resource and then creates a new one with the specified configuration. This means all the existing settings are removed and replaced, which can lead to service disruption if not managed carefully.
?
**Example:**
```bash
kubectl replace -f updated-resource.yaml
```
?
### 3. `kubectl apply`
**Purpose:** This command is used to apply a configuration to a resource in a cluster. It creates the resource if it does not exist, or updates it if it does, while attempting to preserve runtime changes.
?
**Use Case:** Use `kubectl apply` for managing applications through files defining declarative configurations. It is ideal for version-controlled configuration that needs to be pushed to a cluster, as it merges changes incrementally.
?
**Under the Hood:** `kubectl apply` uses a three-way merge strategy. It compares the current configuration (`live`), the input configuration (`new`), and the last-applied configuration, then merges the changes. This approach helps in preserving manual changes made to the live configuration, which are not overwritten by the configuration file.
?
**Example:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f resource.yaml
```
?
### Summary
- **`kubectl create`** is for creating new resources.
- **`kubectl replace`** is for replacing existing resources entirely.
- **`kubectl apply`** is for updating existing resources while preserving runtime changes.
?
Each command is tailored for different scenarios in the lifecycle and management of Kubernetes resources, providing flexibility and control over how changes are applied to the cluster.",Y,"What I understood by the documentation is that:

kubectl create, Creates a new k8s resource in the cluster

kubectl replace, Updates a resource in the live cluster

What are the use cases for these operations?
How do they differ from each other under the hood?
","### **Key Points:**
1. Use **Imperative Management** with `kubectl create` to specify what to create, replace, or delete in the Kubernetes API. 
   ```bash
   kubectl create <resource>
   ```
2. Use **Declarative Management** with `kubectl apply` to maintain changes to live objects, allowing for updates without errors if the resource already exists.
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f <file.yaml>
   ```","### **Key Points:**
1. Use `kubectl create` to create a new resource in the cluster from a configuration file, ensuring the resource does not already exist.

36,"The issue #47538 that @jdf mentioned is now closed and this is now possible. The original implementation can be found here but the syntax has changed.
With kubectl v1.10.1+ the command is:
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<cronjob-name> <job-name> -n namespace-name
It seems to be backwardly compatible with older clusters as it worked for me on v0.8.x.","To manually trigger a Kubernetes Scheduled Job (also known as a CronJob), you can create a Job from the CronJob's template. This allows you to run the job immediately, outside of its scheduled times. Here's how you can do it:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Manually Trigger a Kubernetes CronJob

1. **Get the CronJob YAML**: First, you need to get the YAML definition of the CronJob you want to trigger. You can do this by using the `kubectl` command. Replace `<cronjob-name>` with the name of your CronJob and `<namespace>` with the namespace it resides in (if it's not in the default namespace).

   ```bash
   kubectl get cronjob <cronjob-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
   ```

2. **Create a Job YAML from CronJob**: Extract the `jobTemplate` section from the CronJob YAML. This section contains the template that Kubernetes uses to create new Jobs according to the schedule. You'll need to make a slight modification to use it as a standalone Job.

   Here's an example of what the Job YAML might look like, extracted and modified from the CronJob's `jobTemplate`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: Job
   metadata:
     name: <job-name>  # You can specify a unique name for the job
     namespace: <namespace>
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: <container-name>
           image: <image>
           # Add other container specs here
         restartPolicy: Never
   ```

   Make sure to replace `<job-name>`, `<namespace>`, `<container-name>`, and `<image>` with appropriate values.

3. **Create the Job**: Once you have your Job YAML ready, you can create the Job in Kubernetes by applying the YAML file:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f job.yaml
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer not to create a YAML file, you can use `kubectl create` directly from the command line:

   ```bash
   kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<cronjob-name> <job-name> -n <namespace>
   ```

   This command creates a new Job based on the template of the specified CronJob.

### Reasons for This Approach

- **Testing and Debugging**: Manually triggering a Job allows you to test and debug the job execution without waiting for the scheduled time. This is particularly useful during development and troubleshooting.
- **Control and Flexibility**: You have control over when the job runs, which is useful for operations that need to be performed immediately or on an ad-hoc basis.
- **Isolation**: Running a Job manually from the CronJob template ensures that the execution environment is the same as it would be during scheduled runs, maintaining consistency.

By following these steps, you can manually trigger a Kubernetes CronJob whenever needed, providing flexibility in managing scheduled tasks.",Y,"I've created a Kubernetes Scheduled Job, which runs twice a day according to its schedule. However, I would like to trigger it manually for testing purposes. How can I do this?","### **Key Points:**

1. Retrieve the CronJob YAML definition using the command: ```kubectl get cronjob <cronjob-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml```.
2. Create a Job YAML from the CronJob's `jobTemplate`, modifying it as needed, for example:

   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: Job
   metadata:
     name: <job-name>
     namespace: <namespace>
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: <container-name>
           image: <image>
         restartPolicy: Never
   ```
3. Create the Job in Kubernetes using the command: ```kubectl apply -f job.yaml``` or directly with: ```kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<cronjob-name> <job-name> -n <namespace>```."
